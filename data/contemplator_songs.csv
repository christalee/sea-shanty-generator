0,A Hundred Years Ago,"A hundred years is a very long time,
Ho, yes, ho!
A hundred years is a very long time,
A hundred years ago.

They used to think that pigs could fly
Ho, yes, ho!
I don't believe it, no, not I.
A hundred years ago.

They thought he moon was made of cheese.
Ho, yes, ho!
You can believe it if you please.
A hundred years ago.

They thought the stars were set a-light,
Ho, yes, ho!
By some good angel every night,
A hundred years ago.

They hung a man for making steam,
They cast his body in the stream.
A hundred years ago.

A hundred years is a very long time,
Ho, yes, ho!
A hundred years is a very long time,
A hundred years ago."
1,"Aweigh, Santy Ano","From Boston Town we're bound away,
Heave aweigh (Heave aweigh!) Santy Ano.
Around Cape Horn to Frisco Bay,
We're bound for Californi-o.
So Heave her up and away we'll go,
Heave aweigh (Heave aweigh!) Santy Ano.
Heave her up and away we'll go,
We're bound for Californi-o.

She's a fast clipper ship and a bully crew,
Heave aweigh (Heave aweigh!) Santy Ano.
A down-east Yankee for her captain, too.
We're bound for Californi-o.
So Heave her up and away we'll go,
Heave aweigh (Heave aweigh!) Santy Ano.
Heave her up and away we'll go,
We're bound for Californi-o.

Back in the days of Forty-nine,
Heave aweigh (Heave aweigh!) Santy Ano.
Those were the days of the good old times,
Way out in Californi-o.
So Heave her up and away we'll go,
Heave aweigh (Heave aweigh!) Santy Ano.
Heave her up and away we'll go,
We're bound for Californi-o.

When I leave ship I'll settle down
Heave aweigh (Heave aweigh!) Santy Ano
I'll marry a girl named Sally Brown
Way out in Californi-o
So Heave her up and away we'll go,
Heave aweigh (Heave aweigh!) Santy Ano.
Heave her up and away we'll go,
We're bound for Californi-o.

There's plenty of gold, so I've been told,
Heave aweigh (Heave aweigh!) Santy Ano.
Plenty of gold so I've been told
Way out in Californi-o
So Heave her up and away we'll go,
Heave aweigh (Heave aweigh!) Santy Ano.
Heave her up and away we'll go,
We're bound for Californi-o."
2,The Black Ball Line,"In the Black Ball Line I serv'd my time
Hurrah for the Black Ball Line!
In the Black Ball Line I serv'd my time
Hurrah for the Black Ball Line!

The Black Ball ships are good and true,
Hurrah for the Black Ball Line!
They are the ships for me and you.
Hurrah for the Black Ball Line!

For once there was a Black Ball ship,
Hurrah for the Black Ball Line!
That fourteen knots an hour could slip,
Hurrah for the Black Ball Line!

Her yards were square, her gear all new,
Hurrah for the Black Ball Line!
She had a good and gallant crew,
Hurrah for the Black Ball Line!

One day whilst sailing on the sea,
Hurrah for the Black Ball Line!
They saw a vessel on their lee,
Hurrah for the Black Ball Line!

They knew it was a pirate craft,
All armed with guns before and aft,

She fired a shot across their bow,
Hurrah for the Black Ball Line!
Which was not kind you must allow,
Hurrah for the Black Ball Line!

They did not fear as you may think
Hurrah for the Black Ball Line!
But made the pirates water drink,
Hurrah for the Black Ball Line!

They gave that vessel their sharp stem,
Hurrah for the Black Ball Line!
And cut her through; more praise to them,
Hurrah for the Black Ball Line!

They seized the pirates' wicked mate,
Hurrah for the Black Ball Line!
He was so bad they broke his pate,
Hurrah for the Black Ball Line!

The skipper and his wicked crew,
Hurrah for the Black Ball Line!
They sunk beneath the waters blue,
Hurrah for the Black Ball Line!

It was a plucky thing to do
Hurrah for the Black Ball Line!
To cut the Pirate vessel through,
Hurrah for the Black Ball Line!

Then drink success to the Black Ball Line,
Hurrah for the Black Ball Line!
Their ships are good, their men are fine.
Hurrah for the Black Ball Line!

In the Black Ball Line I served my time,
Hurrah for the Black Ball Line!
In the Black Ball Line I served my time,
Hurrah for the Black Ball Line!"
3,Blow the Man Down,"Come all ye young fellows that follow the sea,
to my way haye, blow the man down,
And pray pay attention and listen to me,
Give me some time to blow the man down.


I'm a deep water sailor just in from Hong Kong,
to my way haye, blow the man down,
if you'll give me some grog, I'll sing you a song,
Give me some time to blow the man down.


'Twas on a Black Baller I first served my time,
to my way haye, blow the man down,
And on that Black Baller I wasted my prime,
Give me some time to blow the man down.


'Tis when a Black Baller's preparing for sea
to my way haye, blow the man down,
You'd split your sides laughing at the sights that you see.
Give me some time to blow the man down.


With the tinkers and tailors and soljers and all
to my way haye, blow the man down,
That ship for prime seaman on board a Black Ball.
Give me some time to blow the man down.


'Tis when a Black Baller is clear of the land,
to my way haye, blow the man down,
Our Boatswain then gives us the word of command
Give me some time to blow the man down.


""Lay aft,"" is the cry,""to the break of the Poop!
to my way haye, blow the man down,
Or I'll help you along with the toe of my boot!""
Give me some time to blow the man down.


'Tis larboard and starboard on the deck you will sprawl,
to my way haye, blow the man down,
For ""Kicking Jack"" Williams commands the Black Ball.
Give me some time to blow the man down.


Pay attention to order, now you one and all,
to my way haye, blow the man down,
For right there above you flies the Black Ball.
Give me some time to blow the man down."
4,"Blow Boys, Blow","A Yankee ship came down the river
Blow, boys, blow!
Her masts and spars they shone like silver
Blow my bully boys blow!

How do you know she's a Yankee liner?
Blow, boys, blow!
The Stars and Stripes float out behind her.
Blow my bully boys blow!

How do you know she's a Yankee packet?
Blow, boys, blow!
They fired a gun, I heard the racket
Blow my bully boys blow!

And who d'you think is the captain of her?
Blow, boys, blow!
Why, Bully Hayes is the captain of her.
Blow my bully boys blow!

Oh, Bully Hayes, he loves us sailors;
Blow, boys, blow!
Yes, he does like hell and blazes!
Blow my bully boys blow!

And who d'you think is the mate aboard her:
Blow, boys, blow!
Santander James is the mate aboard her.
Blow my bully boys blow!

Santander James, he's a rocket from hell, boys,
Blow, boys, blow!
He'll ride you down as you ride the spanker.
Blow my bully boys blow!

And what d'you think they've got for dinner?
Blow, boys, blow!
Pickled eels' feet and bullock's liver.
Blow my bully boys blow!

Then blow, my bullies, all together,
Blow, boys, blow!
Blow, my boys, for better weather.
Blow my bully boys blow!

Blow, boys, blow, the sun's drawing water;
Blow, boys, blow!
Three cheers for tlhe cook and one for his daughter.
Blow my bully boys blow!

A Yankee ship on the Congo River,
Blow, boys, blow!
Her masts they bend and her sails they shiver.
Blow my bully boys blow!"

6,The Coasts of High Barbary,"Look ahead, look a stern,
Look the weather in the lee,
Blow high! Blow low! And so sailed we.
I see a wreck to the windward
And a lofty ship to lee,
A sailing down all on
The coasts of High Barbary

O are you a pirate
Or a man-o-war? cried we.
Blow high! Blow low! And so sailed we.
O no! I'm not a pirate
But a man-o-war, cried he.
A sailing down all on
The coasts of High Barbary

We'll back up our topsails
And heave our vessel to;
Blow high! Blow low! And so sailed we.
For we have got some letters
To be carried home by you.
A sailing down all on
The coasts of High Barbary

For broadside, for broadside
They fought all on the main;
Blow high! Blow low! And so sailed we.
Until at last the frigate
Shot the pirate's mast away.
A sailing down all on
The coasts of High Barbary

For quarters! For quarters!
The saucy pirates cried,
Blow high! Blow low! And so sailed we.
The quarters that we showed them
Was to sink them in the tide.
A sailing down all on
The coasts of High Barbary

With cutlass and gun,
O we fought for hours three;
Blow high! Blow low! And so sailed we.
The ship it was their coffin
And their grave it was the sea.
A sailing down all on
The coasts of High Barbary"
7,The Dead Horse,"A poor old man came riding by
Chorus 1
And we say so, and we hope so
A poor old man came riding by
Chorus 2
Oh, poor old horse.

Says I, ""Old man, your horse will die.""
Chorus 1
Says I, ""Old man, your horse will die.""
Chorus 2

And if he dies we'll tan his skin
Chorus 1
And if he don't we'll ride him again.
Chorus 2

For one long month I rode him hard
Chorus 1
For one long month we all rode him hard.
Chorus 2

But now your month is up, old Turk
Chorus 1
Get up, you swine, and look for work
Chorus 2

Get up you swine and look for graft
Chorus 1
While we lays on and drags ye aft
Chorus 2

He's as dead as a nail in the lamp-room door
Chorus 1
And he won't come worring us no more
Chorus 2

We'll use the hair of his tail to sew our sails
Chorus 1
And the iron of his shoe to make deck nails
Chorus 2

We'll hoist him up to the fore yard-arm
Chorus 1
Where he won't do sailors any harm
Chorus 2

We'll drop him down with a long, long roll
Chorus 1
Where the sharks will have his body and the
Devil take his soul."
8,The Dreadnought,"There's a saucy wild packet, and a packet of fame;
She belongs to New York, and the Dreadnought's her name;
She is bound to the westward where the stormy winds blow;
Bound away in the Dreadnought, to the west'ard we'll go.

There time of her sailing is now drawing nigh;
Farewell, pretty May, I must bid you good-bye;
Farewell to old England and all there we hold dear,
Bound away in the Dreadnought, to the west'ard we'll steer.

Oh, the Dreadnought is pulling out of Waterlock dock,
Where the boys and girls to the pierheads do flock;
They will give us three cheers while their tears do flow,
Saying, ""God bless the Dreadnought, where'er she may go!""

Oh, the Dreadnought is waiting in the Mersey so free,
Waiting for the Independence to tow her to sea,
For around that rock light where the Mersey does flow,
Bound away in the Dreamings, to the westward we'll go.

Oh, the Dreadnought's a-bowlin' down the wild Irish Sea,
Where the passengers are merry, their hearts full of glee,
While her sailors like lions walk the decks to and fro,
She's the Liverpool packet, oh, Lord, let her go!

Oh, the Dreadnought's a-sailing the Atlantic so wide,
While the dark, heavy seas roll along her black sides,
With her sails neatly spread, and the Red Cross to show,
She's the Liverpool packet, oh Lord, let her go!

Oh, the Dreadnought's becalmed on the banks of Newfoundland,
Where the water's so green and the bottom is sand;
Where the fish of the ocean swim round to and fro,
She's the Liverpool packet, oh Lord, let her go!

Oh, the Dreadnought, she's a-bowlin' past old Nantucket Head,
And the man in chains takes a cast with the lead,
The up jumps the flounder just fresh from the ground,
Crying, ""Blast your eyes, Chucklehead;
      and mind where you sound!""

Oh, the Dreadnought's arrived in America once more,
We'll go ashore, shipmates, on the land we adore,
See our wives and our sweethearts, be merry and free,
Drink a health to the Dreadnought, whereso'er she may be.

Here's a health to the Dreadnought, and to all her brave crew.
Here's a health to her captain and officers too.
Talk about your flash packets, Swallow Tail and Black Ball,
But the Dreadnought's the clipper to beat one and all."
9,Drunken Sailor,"Chorus
Way, hay up she rises,
Way, hay, up she rises,
Way, hay, up she rises,
Earlye in the morning!

What will we do with the drunken sailor?
What will we do with the drunken sailor?
What will we do with the drunken sailor?
Earlye in the morning?

Put him in the scuppers with the hose pipe on him

Hoist him aboard with a running bowline

Put him in the brig until he's sober.

Make him turn to at shining bright work.

Other verses from The Book of Navy Songs
(If the verse is the same I did not repeat it)

Put him in a boat and row him over

Hoist him up to the topsail yardarm

Make him clean out all the spit-kids

That's what you do with a drunken sailor

(The last line of this verse is followed
by ""Amen"")"
10,Eliza Lee,"Oh, the smartest packet you can find,
Ah he, ah ho, are you most done?
Is the fair ""Rosalind"" in the Blackball line!
So the clear the track, let the bulgine run,
To my aye rig a jig in the low back car,
Ah he, ha ho, are you most done?
With Eliza Lee all on my knee,
So clear the track, let the bulgine run.

The fair ""Rosalind"" one bright summer's day,
Ah he, ah ho, are you most done?
Went sailing away far out over the bay,
So the clear the track, let the bulgine run,
To my aye rig a jig in the low back car,
Ah he, ha ho, are you most done?
With Eliza Lee all on my knee,
So clear the track, let the bulgine run.

The tiller one hand firmly grasp'd,
Ah he, ah ho, are you most done?
And Eliza's waist by the other was clasp'd,
So the clear the track, let the bulgine run,
To my aye rig a jig in the low back car,
Ah he, ha ho, are you most done?
With Eliza Lee all on my knee,
So clear the track, let the bulgine run.

Oh the day was fine, the wind was free,
Ah he, ah ho, are you most done?
And Eliza Lee sat there on my knee,
So the clear the track, let the bulgine run,
To my aye rig a jig in the low back car,
Ah he, ha ho, are you most done?
With Eliza Lee all on my knee,
So clear the track, let the bulgine run.

Oh, Eliza Lee all on my knee,
Ah he, ah ho, are you most done?
Was as pretty a sight as any could see!
So the clear the track, let the bulgine run,
To my aye rig a jig in the low back car,
Ah he, ha ho, are you most done?
With Eliza Lee all on my knee,
So clear the track, let the bulgine run.

Oh, I said, ""My dear, will you be mine?""
Ah he, ah ho, are you most done?
Her answer was sweeter than sweetest of wine,
So the clear the track, let the bulgine run,
To my aye rig a jig in the low back car,
Ah he, ha ho, are you most done?
With Eliza Lee all on my knee,
So clear the track, let the bulgine run.

Oh the smartest packet you can find,
Ah he, ah ho, are you most done?
Is the fair ""Rosalind"" in the Blackwall line
So the clear the track, let the bulgine run,
To my aye rig a jig in the low back car,
Ah he, ha ho, are you most done?
With Eliza Lee all on my knee,
So clear the track, let the bulgine run."
11,Fire Down Below,"Fire in the galley, fire in the house,
Fire in the beef kid, scorching the scouse.
Fire, fire, fire down below,
Fetch a bucket of water,
Fire down below.

Fire in the cabin, fire in the hold,
Fire in the strong room melting the gold.
Fire, fire, fire down below,
Fetch a bucket of water,
Fire down below.

Fire round the capstan, fire on the mast,
Fire on the main deck, burning it fast.
Fire, fire, fire down below,
Fetch a bucket of water,
Fire down below.

Fire in the lifeboat, fire in the gig,
Fire in the pig-stye roasting the pig.
Fire, fire, fire down below,
Fetch a bucket of water,
Fire down below.

Fire in the store room spoiling the food,
Fire on the orlop burning the wood.
Fire, fire, fire down below,
Fetch a bucket of water,
Fire down below.

Fire on the waters, fire high above,
Fire in our hearts for the friends that we love.
Fire, fire, fire down below,
Fetch a bucket of water,
Fire down below."
12,The Fish Of The Sea,"Come all you young sailormen, listen to me
I'll sing you a song of the fish in the sea,
and it's...
Windy weather boys, stormy weather, boys
When the wind blows we're all together, boys
Blow ye winds westerly, blow ye winds, blow
Jolly sou'wester, boys, steady she goes.

Up jumps the eel with his slippery tail,
Climbs up aloft and reefs the topsail,
and it's...
Windy weather boys, stormy weather, boys
When the wind blows we're all together, boys
Blow ye winds westerly, blow ye winds, blow
Jolly sou'wester, boys, steady she goes.

Then up jumps the shark with his nine rows of teeth
Saying, 'You eat the dough boys, and I'll eat the beef!'
and it's...
Windy weather boys, stormy weather, boys
When the wind blows we're all together, boys
Blow ye winds westerly, blow ye winds, blow
Jolly sou'wester, boys, steady she goes.

Up jumps the lobster with his heavy claws,
Bites the main boom right off by the jaws!
and it's...
Windy weather boys, stormy weather, boys
When the wind blows we're all together, boys
Blow ye winds westerly, blow ye winds, blow
Jolly sou'wester, boys, steady she goes.

Up jumps the halibut, lies flat on the deck
He says, 'Mister Captain, don't step on my neck!'
and it's...
Windy weather boys, stormy weather, boys
When the wind blows we're all together, boys
Blow ye winds westerly, blow ye winds, blow
Jolly sou'wester, boys, steady she goes.

Up jumps the herring, the king of the sea,
Saying, 'All other fishes, now you follow me!'
and it's...
Windy weather boys, stormy weather, boys
When the wind blows we're all together, boys
Blow ye winds westerly, blow ye winds, blow
Jolly sou'wester, boys, steady she goes.

Up jumps the codfish with his chuckle-head,
He runs out up forward and throws out the lead!
and it's...
Windy weather boys, stormy weather, boys
When the wind blows we're all together, boys
Blow ye winds westerly, blow ye winds, blow
Jolly sou'wester, boys, steady she goes.

Up jumps the whale... the largest of all,
'If you want any wind, well, I'll blow ye a squall!'
and it's...
Windy weather boys, stormy weather, boys
When the wind blows we're all together, boys
Blow ye winds westerly, blow ye winds, blow
Jolly sou'wester, boys, steady she goes.

Windy weather boys, stormy weather, boys
When the wind blows we're all together, boys
Blow ye winds westerly, blow ye winds, blow
Jolly sou'wester, boys, steady she goes."
13,The Golden Vanity,"There was a ship that sailed
all on the Lowland Sea,
and the name of our ship
was the Golden Vanity
and we feared she would be taken
by the Spanish enemy
as she sailed in the Lowland,
Lowland, low
as she sailed in the Lowland sea.

Then up stepped our cabin boy
and boldly outspoke he
and he said to our captain
""what would you give to me
If I would swim along side
of the Spanish enemy
and sink her in the Lowland,
Lowland, low
and sink her in the Lowland, sea

""Oh, I would give you silver
and I would give you gold,
And my own fairest daughter
your bonny bride shall be,
If you will swim along side
of the Spanish enemy
and sink her in the Lowland,
Lowland low
And sink her in the Lowland sea.

The the boy he made him read
And overboard sprang he
and he swam alongside
of the Spanish enemy
And with his brace and auger
in her side he bored holes three,
And he sunk her in the Lowland,
Lowland Low,
And he sunk her in the Lowland Sea.

Then quickly he swam back
to the cheering of the crew
But the captain would not heed him
for his promise he did rue,
and he scorned his poor entreatings
when loudly he did sue,
And he left him in the Lowland,
Lowland, Low
And he left him in the Lowland Sea.

Then quickly he swam round
to the port side
And up to his messmates
full bitterly he cried,
""Oh, messmates, draw me up
for I'm drifting with the tide,
And I'm sinking in the Lowland,
Lowland, Low
I'm sinking in the lowland sea.""

Then his messmates drew him up,
But on the deck he died,
And they stitched him in his hammock
Which was so fair and wide,
And they lowered him overboard
And he drifted with the tide,
And he sank in the Lowland,
Lowland, low
And he sank in the Lowland sea."
14,Hanging Johnny,"They call me hanging Johnnie,
Horray, Hooray!
They call me hanging Johnnie,
Hang, boys, hang.

They say I hang for money,
Horray, Hooray!
But saying so is funny;
Hang, boys, hang.

I'd hang the highway robber,
Horray, Hooray!
I'd hang the burglar jobber;
Hang, boys, hang.

I'd hang a noted liar,
Horray, Hooray!
I'd hang a bloated friar;
Hang, boys, hang.

Come hang, come haul together,
Horray, Hooray!
Come hang for finer weather,
Hang, boys, hang.

I'd hang a brutal mother,
Horray, Hooray!
I'd hang her and no other;
Hang, boys, hang.

I'd hang to make things jolly,
Horray, Hooray!
I'd hang all wrong and folly;
Hang, boys, hang.

They call me hanging Johnnie.
Horray, Hooray!
They call me hanging Johnnie,
Hang, boys, hang."
15,"Haul Away, Joe! (Version 1)","When I was a little lad
And so my mother told me,
Way, haul away, we'll haul away Joe,
That if I did not kiss a gal
My lips would grow all moldy,
Way, haul away, we'll haul away Joe.
Way, haul away, we'll haul for better weather,
Way, haul away, we'll haul away Joe.

King Louis was the King of France
Before the Revolution,
Way, haul away, we'll haul away Joe,
King Louis got his head cut off
Which spoiled his constitution.
Way, haul away, we'll haul away Joe.
Way, haul away, we'll haul for better weather,
Way, haul away, we'll haul away Joe.

Oh the cook is in the galley
Making duff so handy
Way, haul away, we'll haul away Joe,
And the captain's in his cabin
Drinkin' wine and brandy
Way, haul away, we'll haul away Joe.
Way, haul away, we'll haul for better weather,
Way, haul away, we'll haul away Joe."
16,"Haul Away, Joe! (Version 2)","Haul away the bowline
The Yankee ship's a rollin',
Haul away! Haul away! Haul away, Joe!

Once I had a Yankee girl,
And she was such a daisy,
Haul away! Haul away! Haul away, Joe!

Once I had a Scotch girl,
And she was fat and lazy,
Haul away! Haul away! Haul away, Joe!

Then I had an English girl,
And she was tall and crazy,
Haul away! Haul away! Haul away, Joe!"
17,The Holy Ground Once More,"Fare thee well, my lovely Dinah,
a thousand times adieu.
We are bound away from the Holy Ground
and the girls we love so true.
We'll sail the salt seas over
and we'll return once more,
And still I live in hope to see
the Holy Ground once more.
You're the girl that I adore,
And still I live in hope to see
the Holy Ground once more.

Now when we're out a-sailing
and you are far behind
Fine letters will I write to you
with the secrets of my mind,
The secrets of my mind, my girl,
you're the girl that I adore,
And still I live in hope to see
the Holy Ground once more.
You're the girl that I adore,
And still I live in hope to see
the Holy Ground once more.

Oh now the storm is raging
and we are far from shore;
The poor old ship she's sinking fast
and the riggings they are tore.
The night is dark and dreary,
we can scarcely see the moon,
But still I live in hope to see
the Holy Ground once more.
You're the girl that I adore,
And still I live in hope to see
the Holy Ground once more.

It's now the storm is over
and we are safe on shore
We'll drink a toast to the Holy Ground
and the girls that we adore.
We'll drink strong ale and porter
and we'll make the taproom roar,
And when our money is all spent
we'll go to sea once more.
You're the girl that I adore,
And still I live in hope to see
the Holy Ground once more."
18,Homeward Bound,"Our anchor we'll weigh,
And our sails we will set.
Goodbye, fare-ye-well,
Goodbye, fare-ye-well.
The friends we are leaving,
We leave with regret,
Hurrah, my boys, we're homeward bound.

We're homeward bound,
Oh joyful sound!
Goodbye, fare-ye-well,
Goodbye, fare-ye-well.
Come rally the capstan,
And run quick around.
Hurrah, my boys, we're homeward bound.

We're homeward bound
We'd have you know
Goodbye, fare-ye-well,
Goodbye, fare-ye-well.
And over the water
To England must go,
Hurrah, my boys, we're homeward bound.

Heave with a will,
And heave long and strong,
Goodbye, fare-ye-well,
Goodbye, fare-ye-well.
Sing a good chorus
For 'tis a good song.
Hurrah, my boys, we're homeward bound.

Hurrah! that good run
Brought the anchor a-weigh,
Goodbye, fare-ye-well,
Goodbye, fare-ye-well.
She's up to the hawse,
Sing before we belay.
Hurrah, my boys, we're homeward bound.

'We're homeward bound,'
You've heard us say,
Goodbye, fare-ye-well,
Goodbye, fare-ye-well.
Hook on the cat fall then,
And rut her away.
Hurrah, my boys, we're homeward bound."
19,The Lass of Swansea Town,"It was down by Swansea barracks
one May morning I strayed
A-viewing of the soldier lads
I spied a comely maid,
It was o'er her red and rosy cheeks
the tears did dingle down,
I thought she was some goddess fair,
the lass of Swansea town.

I said, ""Fair maid, what brought you here,
what brought you here to mourn?""
""Oh I'm in search of Willie dear,
my bonny young sailor boy,
Eight years ago he left me here
for Bermuda he was bound,
He said he would prove faithful to
the lass of Swansea town.""

""If eight years ago he left you
it is useless for to mourn,
For perhaps he is in some battle slain,
or in the ocean drowned.""
""Oh God forbid, young man,"" she said.
""By what token will he be known,
if he ever do return to the
lass of Swansea Town.""

""On his left breast he wears a scar
where he received a wound""
""If by that token your Willie is known
it's him I know right well,
The cannon-ball which made him fall
gave him his deathly wound,
He told me to take care of you
the lass of Swansea town.""

Soon as she heard him say these words
she fell in deep despair,
Wringing of her lily-white hands
and tearing of her hair,
Saying, ""Take me to my Willie,
else give me my death wound,
For no other man will ever enjoy
the lass of Swansea town.""

On coming to herself once more up
from the ground she rose,
His waistcoat it blew open and
the scar it did expose.
They walked till they reached his cottage
and there they settled down,
Young Willie of the royal blue and
the lass of Swansea town."

21,Maid of Amsterdam,"In Amsterdam there lived a maid
Mark you well what I say!
In Amsterdam there lives a maid,
And this fair maid my trust betrayed.

Chorus
I'll go no more a rovin, with you fair maid.
A roving, A roving, since roving's been my ru-i-in,
I'll go no more a roving, with you fair maid.

Her eyes are like two stars so bright
Mark you well what I say
Her eyes are like two stars so bright,
Her face is fair, her step is light.

Chorus

I asked this fair maid to take a walk,
Mark well what I do say
I asked this maid out for a walk
That we might have some private talk.

Chorus

Then I took this fair maid's lily white hand,
Mark well what I do say
I took this fair maid's lily white hand
In mine as we walked along the strand.

Chorus

Then I put my arm around her waist
Mark well what I do say!
For I put my arm around her waist
And from her lips snatched a kiss in haste!

Chorus

Then a great big Dutchman rammed my bow
Mark well what I do say
For a great big Dutchman rammed my bow,
And said, ""Young man, dis bin mein vrow!""

Chorus

Then take warning boys, from me,
Mark well what I do say!
So take a warning, boys, from me,
With other men's wives don't make too free.

Chorus

For if you do you will surely rue
Mark well what I do say!
For if you do you will surely rue
Your act, and find my words come true.

22,New York Girls (Version 1),"As I walked out on South Street,
a fair maid I did meet
Who asked me please to see her home
she lived on Bleecker Street
And away, you Johnny,
my dear honey
Oh you New York girls,
you love us for our money

I said, ""My dear young lady,
I'm a stranger here in town
I left my ship just yesterday,
from Liverpool I was bound.""
And away, you Johnny,
my dear honey
Oh you New York girls,
you love us for our money

I took her out to Tiffany's,
I spared her no expense
I bought her two gold earrings,
they cost me fifteen cents.
And away, you Johnny,
my dear honey
Oh you New York girls,
you love us for our money

She said, ""Come with me, dearie,
I'll stand you to a treat
I'll buy you rum and brandy,
dear, and tab-nabs for to eat.""
And away, you Johnny,
my dear honey
Oh you New York girls,
you love us for our money

And when we reached the barroom, boys,
the drinks was handed round
That liquor was so awful strong,
my head went round and round.
And away, you Johnny,
my dear honey
Oh you New York girls,
you love us for our money

When the drinking it was over,
we straight to bed did go
And little did I ever think
she'd prove my overthrow
And away, you Johnny,
my dear honey
Oh you New York girls,
you love us for our money

When I came to next morning,
I had an aching head
And there was I, Jack-all-alone,
stark naked on the bed
And away, you Johnny,
my dear honey
Oh you New York girls,
you love us for our money

I looked all around the room,
but nothing could I see
But a lady's shift and apron
which now belonged to me
And away, you Johnny,
my dear honey
Oh you New York girls,
you love us for our money

Everything was silent,
the hour was eight o'clock
I put my shift and apron on
and headed for the dock
And away, you Johnny,
my dear honey
Oh you New York girls,
you love us for our money

My shipmates seein' me come aboard,
these words to me did say
""well well, old chap, you've lost your cap
since last you went away.""
And away, you Johnny,
my dear honey
Oh you New York girls,
you love us for our money

""Is this the new spring fashion
the ladies wear ashore?
Where is the shop that sells it?
Have they got any more?""
And away, you Johnny,
my dear honey
Oh you New York girls,
you love us for our money

The Old Man cried, ""why Jack, my boy,
I'm sure I could have found
A better suit than that, by far,
to buy for eighty pounds.""
And away, you Johnny,
my dear honey
Oh you New York girls,
you love us for our money

So come all you bully sailormen,
take warning when ashore
Or else you'll meet some charming girl
who's nothing but a whore
And away, you Johnny,
my dear honey
Oh you New York girls,
you love us for our money

Your hard-earned cash will disappear,
your rig and boots as well
For Yankee girls are tougher than
the other side of Hell.
And away, you Johnny,
my dear honey
Oh you New York girls,
you love us for our money"
23,New York Girls (Version 2),"As I walked down the Broadway
One evening in July
I met a maid who asked me trade
And a sailor John says I
And away, you Santee
My Dear Annie
Oh, you New York girls
can't you dance the polka?

To Tiffany's I took her
I did not mind expense
I bought her two gold earrings
And they cost me fifteen cents
And away, you Santee
My Dear Annie
Oh, you New York girls
can't you dance the polka?

Says she, 'You Limejuice sailor
Now see me home you may'
But when we reached her cottage door
She this to me did say
And away, you Santee
My Dear Annie
Oh, you New York girls
can't you dance the polka?

My flash man he's a Yankee
With his hair cut short behind
He wears a pair of long sea-boots
And he sails in the Blackball Line
And away, you Santee
My Dear Annie
Oh, you New York girls
can't you dance the polka?

He's homeward bound this evening
And with me he will stay
So get a move on, sailor-boy
Get cracking on your way
And away, you Santee
My Dear Annie
Oh, you New York girls
can't you dance the polka?

So I kissed her hard and proper
Afore her flash man came
And fare ye well, me Bowery gal
I know your little game
And away, you Santee
My Dear Annie
Oh, you New York girls
can't you dance the polka?

I wrapped me glad rags round me
And to the docks did steer
I'll never court another maid
I'll stick to rum and beer
And away, you Santee
My Dear Annie
Oh, you New York girls
can't you dance the polka?

I joined a Yankee blood-boat
And sailed away next morn
Don't ever fool around with gals
You're safer off Cape Horn
And away, you Santee
My Dear Annie
Oh, you New York girls
can't you dance the polka?"

25,On Board the Kangaroo,"O, once I was a waterman
And lived at home at ease,
And now I am a mariner
And plough the angry seas.
I thought I'd like seafaring life,
So bid my love adieu,
And shipp'd as cook and steward boys,
On board the Kangaroo.

My love she was no foolish girl,
Her age it was two score,
My love was not a spinster,
She'd been married twice before;
And they could not say it was her wealth
That stole my heart away.
For she was a laundry starcher
At three-and-six a day.

Oh think of me! Oh think of me!
She mournfully did say,
When you are in a foreign land,
Three thousand miles away;
And take this lucky farthing,
'Twill make you bear in mind
The loving, faithful, trusting heart
You leave in tears behind.

Cheer up! Cheer up! my own true love,
Don't weep so bitterly,
But she sobbed and sighed and choked
And cried and couldn't say goodbye.
I won't be gone so very long,
Maybe a month or two,
And when I do come back again,
Of course I'll marry you.

Our vessel it was homeward bound
From many a foreign shore.
And many a foreign present
Unto my love I bore;
There were tortoises from Teneriffe
And toys from Timbuctoo,
A Chinese rat and a Bengal cat
And a Bombay cockatoo.

Paid off, I sought her dwelling
In the suburbs of the town,
An ancient dame upon a line
Was hanging out a gown.
Where is my love? She's married, sir,
About six months ago,
To a man who drives a hardware van
For Johnny Fox and Co.

Farewell to Dixon's soap suds
From the famous brand called Crown,
To Reckitt's Blue, well known to you,
And Crean's Scouring Brown;
I'll seek some far and distant clime,
I can no longer stay,
For my heart is now so shattered
I must live on China tay."
26,One More Day,"Oh have you heard the news, my Johnny?
One more day!
We're homeward bound tomorrow,
One more day!
Only one more day, my Johnny
Only one more day!

One more day!

Oh heave and sight the anchor, Johnny
One more day!
Oh heave and sight the anchor,
One more day!
Only one more day, my Johnny
Only one more day!
Oh rock and row me over,
One more day!

I'm bound away to leave you, Johnny,
One more day!
But I will not deceive you,
One more day!
Only one more day, my Johnny
Only one more day!
Oh rock and row me over,
One more day!"
27,The Ox-Eyed Man,"The ox-eyed man is the man for me,
He came a sailing from o'er the sea
Heigh ho for the ox-eyed man.

Oh, May in the garden a shelling her peas,
And bird singing gaily among the trees.
Heigh ho for the ox-eyed man.

Oh, May looked up and she saw her fate
In the ox-eyed man passing by the gate
Heigh ho for the ox-eyed man.

The ox-eyed man gave a fond look of love,
And charmed May's heart which was pure as a dove,
Heigh ho for the ox-eyed man.

Oh, May in the parlour a-sitting on his knee,
And kissing the sailor who'd come o'er the sea
Heigh ho for the ox-eyed man.

Oh, May in the garden a-shelling her peas,
Now weeps for the sailor who sail'd o'er the sea.
Heigh ho for the ox-eyed man."

30,Paddy West,"As I was walkin' down London Street,
I come to Paddy West's house,
He gave me a dish of American hash;
he called it Liverpool scouse,
He said, There's a ship and she's wantin' hands,
and on her you must sign,
The mate's a bastard, the captain's worse,
but she will suit you fine.

Chorus:
Take off yer dungaree jacket,
and give yerself a rest,
And we'll think on them cold nor'westers
that we had at Paddy West's.

When we had finished our dinner, boys,
the wind began to blow.
Paddy sent me to the attic,
the main-royal for to stow,
But when I got to the attic,
no main-royal could I find,
So I turned myself 'round to the window,
and I furled the window blind.

Now Paddy he pipes all hands on deck,
their stations for to man.
His wife she stood in the doorway,
a bucket in her hand;
And Paddy he cries, Now let 'er rip!
and she throws the water our way,
Cryin', Clew in the fore t'gan'sl, boys,
she's takin on the spray!

Now seein' she's bound for the south'ard,
to Frisco she was bound;
Paddy he takes a length of rope,
and he lays it on the ground,
We all steps over, and back again,
and he says to me That's fine,
And if ever they ask were you ever at sea
you can say you crossed the line.

To every two men that graduates,
I'll give one outfit free,
For two good men on watch at once,
ye never need to see,
Oilskins, me boys, ye'll never want,
carpet slippers made of felt,
I'll dish out to the pair o' you,
and a rope yarn for a belt.

Paddy says Now pay attention,
these lessons you will learn.
The starboard is where the ship she points,
the right is called the stern,
So look ye aft, to yer starboard port
and you will find northwest.
And that's the way they teach you
at the school of Paddy West.

There's just one thing for you to do
before you sail away,
Just step around the table,
where the bullock's horn do lay Tenn
And if ever they ask Were you ever at sea?
you can say Ten times 'round the Horn
And BeJesus but you're and old sailor man
from the day that you were born.

Put on yer dungaree jacket,
And walk out lookin' yer best,
And tell 'em that you're an old sailor man
That's come from Paddy West's."

Swiftly blows the fav'ring gale,
Strong as springtime in its blossom,
Filling out each bending sail,
And the waves we leave behind us
Seem to murmur as they rise;
We have tarried here to bear you
To the land you dearly prize.
Rolling home, rolling home,
Rolling home across the sea,
Rolling home to dear old England
Rolling home, dear land to thee.

Now, it takes all hands to man the capstan,
Mister see your cables clear!
Soon you'll be sailing homeward bound sir,
And for the channel you will steer.
See your sheets and crew lines free sir,
All your buntlines overhauled;
Are the sheerpoles and gear all ready?
Soon for New England we will steer.
Rolling home, rolling home,
Rolling home across the sea,
Rolling home to dear old England
Rolling home, dear land to thee.

Full ten thousand miles behind us,
And a thousand miles before,
Ancient ocean waves to waft us
To the well remembered shore.
Newborn breezes swell to send us
To our childhood welcome skies,
To the glow of friendly faces
And the glance of loving eyes.
Rolling home, rolling home,
Rolling home across the sea,
Rolling home to dear old England
Rolling home, dear land to thee."

Aye, aye, roll and go!
She is Sal herself, yet Sally's daughter
Spend my money on Sally Brown.

Spend my money on Sally Brown.

Seven long years and she wouldn't marry,

36,The Saucy Sailor Boy,"He was a saucy sailor boy
Who'd come from afar,
To ask a maid to be the bride
Of a poor Jack tar.

The maiden, a poor fisher girl,
Stood close by his side;
With scornful look she answered thus;
I'll not be your bride.

You're mad to think I'd marry you
Too ragged you are;
Begone, you saucy sailor boy,
Begone you Jack tar.

I've money in my pocket, love,
And bright gold in store;
These clothes of mine are all in rags,
But coin can buy more.

Though black my hands my gold is clean
So I'll sail afar,
A fairer maid than you, I ween,
Will wed this Jack tar.

Stay! Stay! you saucy sailor boy,
Do not sail afar;
I love you and will marry you,
You silly Jack tar.

'Twas but to tease I answered so,
I thought you could guess
That when a maiden answers no
She always means yes.

Begone you pretty fisher girl,
Too artful are you;
So spake the saucy sailor boy,
Gone was her Jack tar."

We'll rant and we'll roar on deck and below
Until we see bottom inside the two sunkers
When straight through the Channel to Toslow we'll go.

I'm a son of a sea cook, and a cook in a trader

A couple of dollars for clean shirt and collars
And a handful of coppers to make up a feast.

A twenty pound bed from Jimmy McGraw

Of Oderin and Presque, Crabbes Hole and Bruley

A-looking all forlorn.

Whisky drove me around Cape Horn,
Whisky Johnnie.
It was many a month when I was gone,
Whisky for my Johnnie.

I thought I heard the old man say,
Whisky Johnnie.

Whisky for my Johnnie.

A glass of grog for every man,
Whisky Johnnie.
And a bottleful for the chanteyman,
Whisky for my Johnnie."

And we hope in a short time to see you again
We'll rant and we'll roar like true Yankee Whalermen

And straight up the channel to New Bedford we'll go.

We hove our our ship to with the wind from the sou'west, boys.

Haul up your clew garnets, let tacks and sheets fly.

44,Admiral Benbow,"Come all you seamen bold
and draw near, and draw near,
Come all you seamen bold and draw near.
It's of an admiral's fame,
O brave Benbow was his name,
How he fought all on the main,
you shall hear, you shall hear.

Brave Benbow he set sail
For to fight, for to fight
Brave Benbow he set sail for to fight.
Brave Benbow he set sail
with a fine and pleasant gale
But his captains they turn'd tail
in a fright, in a fright.

Says Kirby unto Wade:
We will run, we will run
Says Kirby unto Wade, we will run.
For I value no disgrace,
nor the losing of my place,
But the enemy I won't face,
nor his guns, nor his guns.

The Ruby and Benbow
fought the French, fought the french
The Ruby and Benbow fought the French.
They fought them up and down,
till the blood came trickling down,
Till the blood came trickling down
where they lay, where they lay.

Brave Benbow lost his legs
by chain shot, by chain shot
Brave Benbow lost his legs by chain shot.
Brave Benbow lost his legs,
And all on his stumps he begs,
Fight on my English lads,
'Tis our lot, 'tis our lot.

The surgeon dress'd his wounds,
Cries Benbow, cries Benbow
The surgeon dress'd his wounds, cries Benbow.
Let a cradle now in haste,
on the quarterdeck be placed
That the enemy I may face
'Til I die, 'Til I die."
45,Andrew Barton,"As itt beffell in midsummer-time,
When burds singe sweetlye on euery tree,
Our noble king, King Henery the Eighth,
Ouer the river of Thames past hee.

Hee was no sooner ouer the riuer,
Downe in a fforrest to take the ayre,
But Eighty merchants of London cittye
Came kneeling before King Henery there.

""O yee are welcome, rich merchants,
Good saylers, welcome unto me!""
They swore by the rood they were saylers good,
But rich merchants they cold not bee.

""To Ffrance nor Fflanders dare we nott passe,
Nor Burdeaux voyage wee dare not ffare,
And all ffor a ffalse robber that lyes on the seas,
And robbs us of our merchants ware.""

King Henery was stout, and he turned him about,
And swore by the Lord that was mickle of might,
""I thought he had not beene in the world throughout
That durst haue wrought England such unright.""

But ever they sighed, and said, ""alas!""
Unto King Harry this answere againe:
""He is a proud Scott that will robb us all
If wee were twenty shipps and hee but one.""

The king looket ouer his left shoulder,
Amongst his lords and barrons soe ffree:
""Have I never lord in all my realme
Will ffeitch yond traitor unto mee?""

""Yes, that dare I!"" sayes my lord Charles Haward,
Neere to the king wheras hee did stand;
""If that Your Grace will give me leave,
My selfe will be the only man.""

""Thou shult have six hundred men"" saith our king,
""And chuse them out of my realme soe ffree;
Besids marriners and boyes
To guide the great shipp on the sea ""

""Ile goe speake with Sir Andrew,"" sais Charles,
      my lord Haward;
""Upon the sea, if he be there
I will bring him and his shipp to shore
Or before my prince I will never come neer.""

The ffirst of all my lord did call
A noble gunner hee was one;
This man was three score yeeres and ten,
Anr Peeter Simon was his name.

""Peeter,"" sais hee, ""I must sayle the sea,
To seeke out an enemye; God be my speed
Before all others I have chosen thee;
Of a hundred gunners thoust be my head.""

""My lord,"" sais hee, ""if you have chosen mee
Of a hundred gunners to be the head,
Hange me att your maine-mast tree
If I misse my marke past three pence bread.""

The next of all my lord he did call,
A noble bowman hee was one;
In Yorekeshire was this gentleman borne,
And William Horsley was his name.

""Horsley,"" sayes hee, ""I must sayle to the sea,
To seeke out an enemye; God be my speede
Before all others I have chosen thee;
Of a hundred bowemen thoust be my head.""

""My lord,"" sais he, ""if you haue chosen mee
Of a hundred bowemen to be the head,
Hang me att your mainemast-tree
If I misse my marke past twelve pence bread.""

With pikes, and gunnes, and bowemen bold
This noble Haward is gone to the sea,
On the day before midsummer-even,
And out att Thames mouth sayled they.

They had not sayled dayes three
Upon their journey they tooke in hand,
But there they mett with a noble shipp,
And stoutely made itt both stay and stand.

""Thou must tell me thy name,"" sais Charles,
     my lord Haward,
""Or who thou art, or ffrom whence thou came,
Yea, and where thy dwelling is,
To whom and where thy shipp does belong.""

""My name,"" says hee, ""is Henery Hunt,
With a pure hart and a penitent mind;
I and my shipp they doe belong
Unto the New-castle that stands vpon Tine""'

""Now thou must tell me, Harry Hunt,
As thou hast sayled by day and by night,
Hast thou not heard of a stout robber?
Men calls him Sir Andrew Bartton, Knight.

But ever he sighed, and sayd, ""Alas!
Ffull well, my lord, I know that wight;
He robd me of my merchants ware,
And I was his prisoner but yesternight.""

""As I was sayling upon the sea,
And a Burdeaux voyage as I did ffare,
He clasped me to his archborde,
And robd me of all my merchantsware.""

""And I am a man both poore and bare,
And every man will have his owne of me,
And I am bound towards London to ffare,
To complaine to my prince Henerye.""

""That shall not need,"" sais my lord Haward;
""If thou canst lett me this robber see,
Ffor euery peny he hath taken thee ffroe,
Thou shalt be rewarded a shilling."" quoth hee.

""Now God fforefend"" sais Henery Hunt
""My lord, you shold worke soe ffarr amisse!
God keepe you out of that traitors hands!
For you wott ffull litle what a man hee is.

""Hee is brasse within, and steele without,
And beames hee beares in his topcastle stronge;
His shipp hath ordinance cleane round about;
Besids, my lord, hee is verry well mand.

""He hath a pinnace, is deerlye dight,
Saint Andrews crosse, that is his guide;
His pinnace beares nine score men and more,
Besids fifteen cannons on euery side.

""If you wvere twenty shippes, and he but one,
Either in archboard or in hall,
He would overcome you everye one,
And if his beames they doe downe ffall""

""This is cold comfort"" sais my Lord Haward,
""To wellcome a stranger thus to the sea;
I'll bring him and his shipp to shore,
Or else into Scottland hee shall carrye mee""

""Then you must gett a noble gunner, my lord,
That can sett well with his eye,
And sinke his pinnace into the sea,
And soone then overcome will hee bee.

""And when that you haue done this,
If you chance Sir Andrew for to bord,
Lett no man to his topcastle goe;
And I will giue you a glasse, my lord.""

""And then you need to ffeare no Scott,
Whether you sayle by day or by night;
And to-morrow, by seven of the clocke,
You shall meete with Sir Andrew Barton, Knight.

""I was his prisoner but yesternight,
And he hath taken mee sworne,"" quoth hee;
""I trust my Lord God will me fforgive
And if that oath then broken bee.""

""You must lend me sixe peeces, my lord;"" quoth hee
""Into my shipp, to sayle the sea,
And tomorrow, by nine of the clocke,
Your Honour againe then will I see.""

And the hache-bord where Sir Andrew lay
Is hached with gold deerlye dight:
""Now by my ffaith;"" sais Charles, my lord Haward
""Then yonder Scott is a worthye wight!""

""Take in your ancyents and your standards,
Yea that no man shall them see,
And put me fforth a white willow wand,
As merchants use to sayle the sea.""

But they stirred neither top nor mast,
But Sir Andrew they passed by:
""whatt English are yonder,"" said Sir Andrew
""That can so litle curtesye?""

""I have beene admirall over the sea
More then these yeeres three;
There is never an English dog, nor Portingall
Can passe this way without leave of me.""

""But now yonder pedlers, they are past
Which is no litle greffe to me;
Ffeich them backe;"" sayes Sir Andrew Barton
""They shall all hang att my maine-mast tree.

With that the pinnace itt shott of
That my Lord Haward might it well ken
Itt stroke downe my lords fforemast
And killed fourteen of my lord his men.

""Come hither, Simon!"" sayes my lord Haward
""Looke that thy words be true thou sayed;
I'll hang thee att my main-mast tree
If thou misse thy marke past twelve pence bread.

Simon was old, but his hart itt was bold;
Hee tooke downe a peece, and layd itt ffull lowe
He put in chaine yeards nine,
Besids other great shott lesse and more.

With that hee lett his gun-shott goe;
Soe well hee settled itt with his eye,
The ffirst sight that Sir Andrew sawe,
Hee see his pinnace sunke in the sea.

When hee saw his pinnace sunke,
Lord! in his hart hee was not well:
""Cutt my ropes! itt is time to be gon!
I'le goe ffeitch yond pedlers backe my selfe!""

When my lord Haward saw Sir Andrew loose,
Lord! in his hart that hee was ffaine:
""Strike on your drummes! spread out your ancyents
Sound out your trumpetts! sound out amaine!""

""Ffight on, my men!"" sais Sir Andrew Bartton;
Weate, howsoever this geere will sway,
Itt is my lord Admirall of England
Is come to seeke mee on the sea.""

Simon had a sonne; with shott of a gunn-
Well Sir Andrew might itt ken-
He shott itt in att a priuye place,
And killed sixty more of Sir Andrews men.

Harry Hunt came in att the other syde,
And att Sir Andrew hee shott then;
He drove downe his fformast-tree,
And killed eighty more of Sir Andrews men.

""I have done a good turne,"" sayes Harry Hunt;
""Sir Andrew is not our kings ffriend;
He hoped to haue undone me yesternight,
But I hope I have quitt him well in the end.""

""Ever alas!"" sayd Sir Andrew Barton
""what shold a man either thinke or say?
Yonder ffalse theeffe is my strongest enemye
Who was my prisoner but yesterday.

""Come hither to me, thou Gourden good,
And be thou readye att my call,
And I will give thee three hundred pound
If thou wilt lett my beames down ffall""

With that hee swarved the maine-mast tree,
Soe did he itt with might and maine;
Horseley, with a bearing arrow,
Stroke the Gourden through the braine.

And he ffell into the haches againe,
And sore of this wound that he did bleed;
There word went through Sir Andrews men,
That the Gourden hee was dead.

""Comie hither to me, James Hambliton,
Thou are my sisters sonne, I have no more;
I will give thee six hundred pound
If thou will lett my beames downe ffall.""

With that hee swarved the maine-mast tree,
Soe did hee itt with might and maine:
Horseley, with another broad arrow,
Strike the yeaman through the braine.

That hee ffell downe to the haches againe;
Sore of his wound that hee did bleed;
Covetousness getts no gaine,
Itt is verry true, as the Welchman sayd.

But when hee saw his sisters sonne slaine,
Lord! in his heart hee was not well:
""Goe ffeitch me downe my armour of prooffe,
For I will to the topcastle my-selfe.

""Goe ffeitch me downe my armour of prooffe,
For it is guilded with gold soe cleare;
God be with my brother, John of Bartton!
Amongst the Portingalls hee did itt weare.""

But when hee had his armour of prooffe,
And on his body hee had itt on,
Every man that looked att him
Sayd, ""Gunn nor arrow he neade feare none""

""Come hither, Horsley!"" sayes my lord Haward,
""And looke your shaft that itt goe right;
Shoot a good shoote in the time of need,
And ffor thy shooting thoust be made a knight!""

""I'le doe my best,"" sayes Horsley then,
""Your Honor shall see beffore I goe;
If I shold be hanged att your mainemast,
I have in my shipp but arrowes tow.""

But att Sir Andrew hee shott then;
Hee mede sure to hitt his marke;
Vnder the spole of his right arme
Hee smote Sir Andrew quite through the hart.

Yett ffrom the tree hee wold not start,
But hee clinged to itt with might and maine;
Vnder the coller then of his jacke,
He stroke Sir Andrew thorrow the braine.

""Ffight on my men,"" sayes Sir Andrew Barton,
""I arm hurt, but I am not slaine;
I'le lay mee downe and bleed a-while,
And then I'le rise and ffight againe.

""Ffight on my men,"" sayes Sir Andrew Bartton
""These English doggs they bite soe lowe;
Ffight on ffor Scottland and Saint Andew
Till you heare my whistle blowe!""

But when they cold not heare his whistle blow,
Sayes Harry Hunt, ""I'le lay my head
You may bord yonder noble shipp, my lord,
For I know Sir Andrew hee is dead.""

With that they borded this noble shipp,
Soe did they itt with might and maine;
The ffound eighteen score Scotts alive,
Besids the rest were maimed and slaine.

My Lord Haward tooke a sword in his hand,
And smote off Sir Andrews head;
The Scotts stood by did weepe and mourne,
But never a word durst speake or say.

He caused his body to be taken downe,
And ouer the hatch-bord cast into the sea,
And about his middle three hundred crownes:
""whersoever thou lands, it will bury thee.""

With his head they sayled into England againe,
With right good will, and fforce and main,
And the day beffore Newyeeres even
Into Thames mouth they came againe.

My lord Haward wrote to King Heneryes grace,
With all the newes hee cold him bring:
""Such a Newyeeres gifft I have brought to your Grace
As neuer did subject to any king.

""Ffor merchandyes and manhood,
The like is nott to be ffound;
The sight of these wold doe you good,
Ffor you haue not the like in your English ground.""

But when hee heard tell that they were come,
Full royally hee welcomed them home;
Sir Andrew's shipp was the kings Newyeeres guifft;
A braver shipp you never saw none.

Now hath our king Sir Andrews shipp,
Besett with pearles and precyous stones;
Now hath England two shipps of warr,
Two shipps of warr, before but one.

""who holpe to this?"" sayes King Henerye,
""That I may reward him ffor his paine:""
""Harry Hunt, and Peeter Simon,
William Horseleay, and I the same.""

""Harry Hunt shall haue his whistle and chain
And all his jewells, whatsoever they be
And other rich giffts that I will not name
For his good service he hath done.""

""Horslay, right thoust be a knight,
Lands and livings thou shalt have store
Haward shall be erle of Nottingham
And soe was never Haward before.

""Now, Peeter Simon, thou art old;
I will maintaine thee and thy sonne;
Thou shalt have five hundred pound all in gold
Ffor the good service that thou hast done.""

Then King Henerye shiffted his roome
In came the Queene and ladyes bright;
Other arrands they had none
But to see Sir Andrew Bartton, Knight.

But when they see his deadly fface,
His eyes were hollow in his head;
""I wold give a hundred pound,"" sais King Henry
""The man were alive as hee is dead!

""Yett for the manfull part that hee hath playd
Both heere and beyond the sea,
His men shall have halfe a crowne a day
To bring them to my brother, King Jamye!"""
46,The Arethusa,"Come, all ye jolly sailors bold,
Whose hearts are cast in honour's mould,
While English glory I unfold,
Hurra for the Arethusa!

She is a frigate tight and brave
As ever stemmed the dashing wave;
Her men are staunch to their fav'rite launch,
And when the foe shall meet our fire,
Sooner than strike we'll all expire,
On board of the Arethusa!

'Twas with the spring fleet she went out,
The English Channel to cruise about,
When four French sail, in show so stout,
Bore down on the Arethusa!

The famed Belle Poole straight a head did lie,
The Arethusa seemed to fly,
Not a sheet or a tack, or a brace did she slack,
Tho' the Frenchmen laugh'd and thought it stuff,
But they knew not the handful of men how tough,
On board of the Arethusa.

On deck five hundred men did dance,
The stoutest they could find in France,
We with two hundred did advance,
On board of the Arethusa.

Our captain hailed the Frenchman, ""Ho!""
The Frenchmen then cried out, ""Hallo!""
""Bear down, d'ye see, to our Admiral's lee,""
""No, no,"" says the Frenchman, ""that can't be,""
""Then I must lug you along with me.""
Says the saucy Arethusa.

The fight was off the Frenchman's land,
We forced them back upon their strand,
For we fought till not a stick would stand,
Of the gallant Arethusa.

And now we've driven the foe ashore,
Never to fight with Britons more,
Let each fill a glass to his fav'rite lass!
A health to the captain and officers true,
And all that belong to the jovial crew,
On board of the Arethusa."
47,The Bay of Biscay,"Loud roars the dreadful thunder,
The rain a deluge show'rs;
The clouds are rent asunder
By lightning's vivid pow'rs;
The night was drear and dark;
Our poor devoted bark
Till next day, there she lay,
In the Bay of Biscay, O!

Now dash'd upon the billow
Her op'ning timbers creak;
Each fears a wat'ry pillow,
None stop the dreadful leak:
To cling to slipp'ry shrouds
Each breathless seaman crowds,
As she lay, till next day,
In the Bay of Biscay, O!

At length the wished for tomorrow
Breaks thro' the hazy sky;
Absorb'd in silent sorrow,
Each heaves a bitter sigh:
The dismal wreck to view
Strikes horror to the crew,
As she lay, on that day,
In the Bay of Biscay, O!

Her yielding timbers sever,
Her pitchy seams are rent;
When heav'n, all bounteous ever,
Its boundless mercy sent:
A sail in sight appears,
We hail her with three cheer!
Now we sail, with the gale,
From the Bay of Biscay, O!"
48,"The Bay of Biscay, O!","Ye gentlemen of England who live home at your ease,
It's little do you think of the dangers of the seas;
When we receive our orders we are obliged to go
On the main to proud Spain where
     the stormy winds do blow.

Was on the fourth of August from Spithead we set sail
With Ramely and Company blest with a pleasant gale;
We sailed along together in the Bay of Biscay, Oh,
Where a dreadful storm it did arise and
     the stormy wind did blow.

The Ramely she left us, she could no longer stay
And by distress of weather from us she bore away;
When she arrived at Gibraltar they told the people so
How they thought we were all lost at the Bay of Biscay, Oh.

Kind heaven did protect her, it was not quite so bad,
First we lost our foremast, and then we lost our flag.
And then we lost our mainmast, one of our guns also
And the men, we lost ten on the Bay of Biscay, Oh.

When the mainmast started, it gave a dreadful stroke,
In our starboard quarter, a large hole did it broke.
Then the seas came battering in, our guns soon overflow
So boldly she plowed it on the Bay of Biscay, Oh.

The night being dark and dreary, at twelve o'clock that night
Our captain in the forecastle he was killed then outright.
The ring upon his finger in pieces burst in two
There he laid until next day when we overboard him threw.

The storm it being abated, we rigged up jury mast
And steered it for Gibraltar, where we arrived at last
They said it was a dismal sight as ever they did know
We forced to drink wine and drowned all our woe."
49,Ben Backstay,"Ben Backstay lov'd the gentle Anna:
Constant as purity was she;
Her honey words, like succ'ring manna
Cheer'd him each voyage he made to sea.
One fatal morning saw them parting:
While each the other's sorrow dried,
They, by the tear that then was starting,
Vow'd to be constant till they died.

At distance from his Anna's beauty,
While howling winds the sky deform,
Ben sighs, and well performs his duty,
And braves for love the frightful storm:
Alas! in vain - the vessel batter'd,
On a rock splitting, open'd wide,
While lacerated, torn, and shatter'd,
Ben thought of Anna, sigh'd and died.

The semblance of each charming feature,
That Ben had worn around his neck,
Where art stood substitute for nature,
A tar, his friend, sav'd from the wreck.
In fervent hope, while Anna, burning,
Blush'd as she wish'd to be a bride,
The portrait came - joy turn'd to mourning
She saw, grew pale, sunk down, and died."
50,Bold Nelson's Praise,"Bold Nelson's praise I am going to sing,
(Not forgetting our glorious King)
He always did good tidings bring,
For he was a bold commander.
There was Sydney Smith and Duncan too,
Lord Howe and all the glorious crew;
They were the men that were true blue.
Full of care, yet I swear
None with Nelson could compare,
Not even Alexander.

Bold Buonaparte he threaten'd war,
A man who fear'd not wound nor scar,
But still he lost at Trafalgar
Where Britain was victorious.
Lord Nelson's actions made him quake,
And all French pow'rs he made to shake;
He said his king he'd ne'er forsake.
These last words thus he spake,
Stand true, my lads, like hearts of oak,
And the battle shall be glorious.

Lord Nelson bold, though threaten'd wide,
And many a time he had been tried,
He fought like a hero till he died
Amid the battle gory.
But the day was won, their line was broke,
While all around was lost in smoke,
And Nelson he got his death-stroke,
That's the man for old England!
He faced his foe with his sword in hand
And he lived and he died in his glory."
51,The Bold Princess Royal,"On the fourteenth of February
We sailed from the land,
In the bold Princess Royal
Bound for Newfoundland,
We had forty brave seamen
For our ship's company,
And boldly from the eastward
To the westward sailed we.

'We had not been sailing
Past days two or three,
When a man from our foremast
A sail he did see,
She hove down upon us
To see what we were,
And under her foremast
Black colours she wore.

Now when this bold pirate
She hove alongside,
With a large speaking trumpet,
'Whence come you?' they cried.
Our captain being aft, boys,
He answered him so;
We come from fair London
And we're bound for Cairo:'

'Come haul down your topsails,
Your sternsails also,
For I have a letter
To send home by you'
'I'll not haul down my topsail
Nor heave my sails to,
But shall be in some harbour,
Not alongside of you?'

They fired shot after us
But could not prevail,
When the bold Princess Royal
Soon shewed them her tail,
They drove us to windward,
But couldn't make us stay,
We hoisted our mainsail
And then bore away.

'Thank God,' cries our captain,
'The pirate is gone.
Come down to your grog boys,
Come down everyone,
Come down to your grog boys
And be of good cheer,
For while we have sea-room,
Brave boys, never fear.'"
52,The Bonny Ship The Diamond,"The Diamond is a ship, my lads,
for the Davis Strait she's bound,
And the Quay it is all garnished
with bonny lasses round;
Captain Thompson gives the order
to sail the ocean wide,
Where the sun it never sets, my lads,
nor darkness dims the sky.
So it's cheer up, my lads,
Let your hearts never fail,
For the bonny ship, The Diamond,
goes a-fishing for the whale.

Along the quay at Peterhead,
the lasses stand around,
Wi' their shawls all pulled about them
and the salt tears running down;
Don't you weep, my bonny lass,
though you be left behind,
For the rose will grow on Greenland's ice
before we change our mind.
So it's cheer up, my lads,
Let your hearts never fail,
For the bonny ship, The Diamond,
goes a-fishing for the whale.

Here's health to The Resolution,
likewise The Eliza Swan,
Here's health to The Battler of Montrose
and The Diamond, ship of fame;
We wear the trousers of the white
and the jackets of the blue,
When we return to Peterhead
we'll ha'e sweethearts enoo.
So it's cheer up, my lads,
Let your hearts never fail,
For the bonny ship, The Diamond,
goes a-fishing for the whale.

It'll be bright both day and night
when the Greenland lads come hame,
With a ship thats fu' o' oil, my lads,
and money to our name;
We'll make the cradles for to rock
and the blankets for to tear,
And every lass in Peterhead sing,
""Hushabye, my dear"".
So it's cheer up, my lads,
Let your hearts never fail,
For the bonny ship, The Diamond,
goes a-fishing for the whale."
53,Captain Kidd,"My name is William Kidd, as I sailed, as I sailed
My name is William Kidd, as I sailed
My name is William Kidd, God's laws I did forbid
And most wickedly I did, as I sailed, as I sailed

Oh, my parents taught me well, as I sailed, as I sailed
My parents taught me well, as I sailed
My parents taught me well to shun the gates of Hell
But against them I rebelled, as I sailed, as I sailed

Oh, I murdered William Moore, as I sailed, as I sailed
I murdered William Moore, as I sailed
I murdered William Moore and I left him in his gore
Many leagues from shore, as I sailed, as I sailed

Oh, I steered from sound to sound, as I sailed, as I sailed
Oh I steered from sound to sound, as I sailed
I steered from sound to sound, and many ships I found
And all of them I burned as I sailed, as I sailed

And being cruel still, as I sailed, as I sailed
And being cruel still, as I sailed
And being cruel still my gunner I did kill
And his precious blood did spill, as I sailed, as I sailed

I was sick and nigh to death, as I sailed, as I sailed
I was sick and nigh to death, as I sailed
I was sick and nigh to death and I vowed with every breath
To walk in wisdom's ways when I sailed, when I sailed

My repentance lasted not, as I sailed, as I sailed
My repentance lasted not, as I sailed
My repentance lasted not, my vows I soon forgot
Damnation was my lot, as I sailed, as I sailed

To execution dock I must go, I must go
To execution dock I must go
To execution dock, while many thousands flock
But I must bear the shock and must die, and must die,

Take a warning now by me, for I must die, for I must die,
Take a warning now by me for I must die
Take a warning now by me and shun bad company,
Lest you come to hell with me, for I must die, I must die."
54,Chesapeake and Shannon,"O the Chesapeake so bold
Out of Boston she was towed
To take an English frigate
Neat and handy, O;
And the people in the port,
They came to see the sport,
Whilst the music played up
Yankee doodle dandy, O.
Hi! Yankee doodle doo,
Yankee doodle dandy!
Hi! Yankee doodle doo,
Yankee doodle dandy!

Now the British frigate's name,
0 that for the purpose came
To cool the Yankees' courage
Neat and handy, 0,
Was the Shannon, Captain Broke,
With his men all hearts of oak,
Who for fighting was allowed to be
The dandy, 0.
Hi! Yankee doodle doo,
Yankee doodle dandy!
Hi! Yankee doodle doo,
Yankee doodle dandy!

Just before the fight began,
Said the Yankees with much fun:
We'll tow her into Boston
Neat and handy, 0;
And then afterwards we'll dine
With our sweethearts and our wives,
And we'll dance the jig called
Yankee doodle dandy, 0.
Hi! Yankee doodle doo,
Yankee doodle dandy!
Hi! Yankee doodle doo,
Yankee doodle dandy!

Now the fight had scarce begun
When they flinch-ed from the guns,
Which they thought that they would fight
So neat and handy, 0;
Then brave Broke he drew his sword, crying:
Now my lads we'll board
And we'll stop them playing
Yankee doodle dandy, 0.
Hi! Yankee doodle doo,
Yankee doodle dandy!
Hi! Yankee doodle doo,
Yankee doodle dandy!

They no sooner heard the word
Than they quickly jumped on board,
And haul-ed down the ensign
Neat and handy, 0.
Notwithstanding all their brag,
Soon the glorious British flag
At the Yankee's mizen-peak it looked
The dandy, 0.
Hi! Yankee doodle doo,
Yankee doodle dandy!
Hi! Yankee doodle doo,
Yankee doodle dandy!

Here's a health, my boys, to you,
With your courage stout and true.
Who fought the Chesapeake
So neat and handy, 0;
And may it ever prove
That in fighting as in love
That the true British sailor
Is the dandy, 0.
Hi! Yankee doodle doo,
Yankee doodle dandy!
Hi! Yankee doodle doo,
Yankee doodle dandy!"
55,The Constitution and the Guerriere,"It oft-times has been told,
That the British seamen bold
Could flog the tars of France
So neat and handy, Oh!
But they never met their match,
Till the Yankees did them catch
Oh, the Yankee boys for fighting
Are the dandy, Oh!

The Guerriere, a frigate bold,
On the foaming ocean rolled
Commanded by proud Dacres,
The grandee, Oh!
With as choice a British crew
As ever a rammer drew
Could flog the Frenchmen
Two to one so handy, Oh!

When the frigate hove in view,
Says proud Dacres to his crew,
Come clear the ship for action
And be handy, Oh!
To the weather-gage, boys, get her.
And to make his men fight better
Gave them to drink, gunpowder
Mixed with brandy, Oh!

Then Dacres loudly cries,
Make this Yankee ship your prize,
You can in thirty minutes,
Neat and handy, Oh!
Twenty-five's enough, I'm sure,
And if you'll do it in a score
I'll treat you to a double
Share of brandy, Oh!

The British shot flew hot,
Which the Yankees answered not
Till they got within the distance
They called handy, Oh!
Now, says Hull unto his crew,
Let us see what we can do,
If we take this boasting Briton
We're the dandy, Oh!

The first broadside we poured
Carried her mainmast by the board
Which made this lofty frigate
Look abandoned, Oh!
Then Dacres shook his head,
And to his officers said,
Lord! I didn't think those Yankees
Were so handy, Oh!

Our secon told so well
That their fore and mizzen fell,
Which doused the royal ensign
Neat and handy, Oh!
By George! says he, We're done!
And they fired a lee gun
While the Yankees struck up
Yankee Doodle Dandy, Oh!

Then Dacres came on board
To deliver up his sword.
Tho'loth was he to part with it,
It was so handy, Oh!
Oh! Keep your sword, says Hull,
For it only makes you dull,
Cheer up, and let us have
A little brandy, Oh!

Now, fill your glasses full,
And we'll drink to Captain Hull
And so merrily we'll push
Around the brandy, Oh!
Johnny Bull may boast his fill,
Let the world say what it will,
The Yankee boys for fighting
Are the dandy, Oh!"
56,The Glasgow,"All you who love your native land
And mean to emigrate
A while draw near and you shall hear
What happened of late
To tell the hardships I went through
Some pages it would fill
When I was forced to leave my home,
That place called Sweet Cootehill.

John Williams is my name,
This truth I'll ne'er deny;
My friends they banished me away,
I'll tell you the reason why -
Because I would not break the vows
I made unto my dear,
They tore me from the arms
Of my charming Sally Greer.

Straight away to Liverpool
My friends did me convey
And in the Glasgow to New York
My passage they did pay
Along with Captain Robinson
And sixteen of a crew
We set out for America
Our fortune to pursue.

'Twas on the eight of February
Our gallant ship set sail
Bound for the city of New York,
With a sweet and pleasant gale.
On the midnight of the seventh day,
Before our captain went to rest
He called unto his chief-mate
And made him this behest.

Take you charge of the vessel,
And of yon rocks keep clear
And beat about the Irish coast
Till daylight doth appear.
Our chief-mate took the orders,
But he did not them obey
And by neglect he let the ship
Go quite out of her way.

Early the following morning,
About half-past four o'clock,
Our gallant ship with all her might
Came on a sunken rock.
These rocks are called The Barrels;
They're hidden from human sight;
They lie abreast of Carnsore Head,
And west of Tuskar Light.

Men, women and children
Were filled with great surprise
A heart like flint it would relent
To hear their dismal cries.
We hoist a light from our mast-head
Before it was daylight
And to our joy and great surprise
A schooner hove in sight.

Captain Walsh gave orders
Unto his seamen brave,
The women and the children
To strive first for to save
With that the Glasgow gave a lurch,
And none could her prevent,
And five-and-twenty fine young men
Down to the bottom went.

Long life to Captain Walsh
And to his seamen brave,
But for his assistance
We'd have met a watery grave.
He landed us in Wexford town
Where we were treated kind.
In time of need indeed 'twas there
Some warm friends we did find.

In these four months four vessels
Wrecked upon the watery main:
The Glasgow and the Mexico,
The Bristol and the Jane.
And nearly a thousand passengers
Lie asleep in watery graves
Men who thought to settle in land
That never sheltered slaves"
57,Heart of Oak,"Come cheer up, my lads! 'tis to glory we steer,
To add something more to this wonderful year;
To honour we call you, not press you like slaves,
For who are so free as the sons of the waves?
Heart of oak are our ships, heart of oak are our men;
We always are ready, steady, boys, steady!
We'll fight and we'll conquer again and again.

We ne'er see our foes but we wish them to stay,
They never see us but they wish us away;
If they run, why we follow, and run them ashore,
For if they won't fight us, we cannot do more.
Heart of oak are our ships, heart of oak are our men;
We always are ready, steady, boys, steady!
We'll fight and we'll conquer again and again.

They swear they'll invade us, these terrible foes,
They frighten our women, our children, and beaus;
But should their flat bottoms in darkness get o'er,
Still Britons they'll find to receive them on shore.
Heart of oak are our ships, heart of oak are our men;
We always are ready, steady, boys, steady!
We'll fight and we'll conquer again and again.

We'll still make them fear, and we'll still make them flee,
And drub 'em on shore, as we've drubb'd 'em at sea;
Then cheer up, my lads! with one heart let us sing:
Our soldiers, our sailors, our statesmen and Queen.
Heart of oak are our ships, heart of oak are our men;
We always are ready, steady, boys, steady!
We'll fight and we'll conquer again and again."
58,Henry Martin,"There were three brothers in merry Scotland,
In merry Scotland there were three,
And they did cast lots which of them should go,
should go, should go,
And turn robber all on the salt sea.

The lot it fell first upon Henry Martin,
The youngest of all three;
That he should turn robber all on the salt sea,
Salt sea, salt sea.
For to maintain his two brothers and he.

He had not been sailing but a long winter's night
And a part of a short winter's day,
Before he espied a stout lofty ship,
lofty ship, lofty ship,
Come abibing down on him straight way.

Hullo! Hullo! cried Henry Martin,
What makes you sail so nigh?
I'm a rich merchant bound for fair London town,
London Town, London Town
Will you please for to let me pass by?

Oh no! Oh no! cried Henry Martin,
That thing it never could be,
For I am turned robber all on the salt sea
Salt sea, salt sea.
For to maintain my brothers and me.

Come lower your topsail and brail up your mizz'n
And bring your ship under my lee,
Or I will give you a full flowing ball,
flowing ball, flowing ball,
And your dear bodies drown in the salt sea.

Oh no! we won't lower our lofty topsail,
Nor bow ourselves under your lee,
And you shan't take from us our rich merchant goods,
merchant goods, merchant goods
Nor point our bold guns to the sea.

With broadside and broadside and at it they went
For fully two hours or three,
Till Henry Martin gave to her the deathshot,
the deathshot, the deathshot,
And straight to the bottom went she.

Bad news, bad news, to old England came,
Bad news to fair London Town,
There's been a rich vessel and she's cast away,
cast away, cast away,
And all of the merry men drown'd."
59,The Isle of France,"The sun was fair and the clouds advanced,
When a convict came to the Isle of France;
Around his leg he wore a ring and chain,
And his country was of the Shamrock Green

I am of the Shamrock' the convict cried,
That has been tossed on the ocean wide;
For being unruly, I do declare,
I was doomed a transport for seven long years -

When six of them they were past and gone,
I was coming home for to make up one,
When the stormy winds they did blow and roar,
Which cast me here on this foreign shore.

Then the coastguard played a noble part,
And with some brandy cheered the convict's heart.
Although the night is so far advanced,
You shall find a friend in the Isle of France.

Then a speedy letter went to the Queen,
About the dreadful shipwreck of the Shamrock Green
His freedom came by a speedy post
To the absent convict they thought was lost.

God bless the coastguard, the convict cried,
You have saved my life from the ocean wide;
I'll drink your health in a flowing glass,
So here's success to the Isle of France."
60,It's of a Sailor Bold,"It's of a sailor bold,
And lately come on shore;
Both brisk and bold,
Well lined with gold,
To his lover he did repair;

In old and ragged dress
Unto his love did go,
Unto his love
All for to prove
Whether she'll be kind or no.

My merchandise I've lost,
My ship is gone astray,
Which makes me fret;
I'm deep in debt,
Not a tenth part can I pay.

Come in, my dear, sit down,
Put off thy ragged array;
And I will be
So kind to thee,
And all thy debts I'll pay.

I've gold in store of my own
My debts all for to clear,
I've rings, I've ribbons,
I've jewels so bright,
And gems to trick the hair.

'Twas down in Stokton Church
The happy knot was tied.
From land to land
There's no man can
Match the sailor and his bride."
61,Johnny Todd,"Johnny Todd, he took a notion
For to cross the ocean wide
And he's left his own true love behind him
Walking by the Liverpool tide

For a week, she wept with sorrow
Tore her hair and wrung her hands
Till she met another handsome sailor
Walking by the Liverpool sands

Fair young maid are you a weeping
For your Johnny gone to sea
If you'll wed with me tomorrow
I will kind and constant be

I will buy you sheets and blankets
I'll buy you a wedding ring
You shall have a silver cradle
For to rock the baby in

Johnny Todd came home from sailing
Sailing on the ocean wide
And he's found his fair and false one
Was another sailor's bride

All young men who go a sailing
For to fight the foreign foe
Do not leave your own true love like johnny
Marry her before you go"
62,The Jolly Young Waterman,"And did you not hear of a jolly young waterman,
Who at Blackfriar's Bridge used for to ply;
And he feather'd his oars with such skill and dexterity
Winning each heart and delighting each eye;
He look'd so neat and row'd so steadily,
The maidens all flock'd in his boat so readily,
And he eyed the young rogues with so charming an air,
He eyed the young rogues with so charming an air,
That this jolly young waterman ne'er was in want of a fare.

What sights of fine folks he oft row'd in his wherry,
'Twas clean'd out so nice and so painted withal:
He always first oars when the fine city ladies,
In a party to Ranelagh went, or Vauxhall:
And often times they would be giggling and jeering,
But 'twas all one to Tom their gibing and jeering;
For loving or liking he little did care,
For loving or liking he little did care;
For this jolly young waterman ne'er was in want of a fare.

And yet, but to see how strangely things happen,
As he row'd along, thinking of nothing at all,
He was ply'd by a damsel so lovely and charming
That she smiled, and so straightway in love he did fall;
And would this young damsel but banish his sorrow,
He'd wed her tonight before tomorrow;
And how should this waterman ever know care,
And how should this waterman ever know care
When he's married and never in want of a fare."
63,"Come, Loose Every Sail to the Breeze","Come loose every sail to the breeze.
The course of my vessel improve;
I've done with the toils of the seas,
Ye sailors, I'm bound to my love.
Ye sailors, I'm bound to my love,
Ye sailors, I'm bound to my love,
I've done with the toils of the seas,
Ye sailors, I'm bound to my love.

Since Emma is true as she's fair,
My griefs I fling all to the wind,
'Tis a pleasing return for my care,
My mistress is constant and kind.
Ye sailors, I'm bound to my love,
Ye sailors, I'm bound to my love,
I've done with the toils of the seas,
Ye sailors, I'm bound to my love.

My sails are all filled to my dear,
What tropic bird swifter can move?
Who, cruel, shall hold his career,
That returns to the nest of his love?
Ye sailors, I'm bound to my love,
Ye sailors, I'm bound to my love,
I've done with the toils of the seas,
Ye sailors, I'm bound to my love.

Then hoist every sail to the breeze,
Come, shipmates, and join in the song;
Let's drink while the ship cuts the seas,
To the gale that may drive her along.
Ye sailors, I'm bound to my love,
Ye sailors, I'm bound to my love,
I've done with the toils of the seas,
Ye sailors, I'm bound to my love."
64,Lord Franklin,"We were homeward bound one night on the deep
Swinging in my hammock I fell asleep
I dreamed a dream and I thought it true
Concerning Franklin and his gallant crew

With 100 seamen he sailed away
To the frozen ocean in the month of May
To seek a passage around the pole
Where we poor sailors do sometimes go.

Through cruel hardships they vainly strove
Their ships on mountains of ice was drove
Only the Eskimo with his skin canoe
Was the only one that ever came through

In Baffin's Bay where the whale fish blow
The fate of Franklin no man may know
The fate of Franklin no tongue can tell
Lord Franklin among his seamen do dwell"
65,"The Low, Low Lands of Holland","The very day I was married,
That night I lay on my bed;
A press gang came to my bedside
These words to me they said:
Arise, arise, arise, young man,
And come along with me, with me,
To the low, low lands of Holland,
To face your enemy.

But Holland is a cold place,
A place where grows no green,
And Holland is a cold place
For my love to wander in.
Though money had been as plentiful
As leaves upon the tree, the tree
Yet before I'd time to turn myself
My love was stol'n from me.

I'll build my love a gallant ship,
A ship of noted fame.
With four and twenty seamen bold
To box her on the main.
They'll rant and roar in sparkling glee,
Where some ever they do go, do go,
To the low, low lands of Holland,
To face the daring foe.

Says the mother to the daughter;
What makes you to lament?
O there are lords and dukes and squires
Can ease your heart's content.
But never will I married be
Until the day I die, I die,
since the low, low lands of Holland
Have parted my love and me.

There's not a swaithe goes round my waist
Nor comb goes in my hair,
Neither firelight nor candle light
Can ease my heart's despair.
And never will I married be
Until the day I die, I die
Since the low, low lands of Holland
Have parted my love and me."
66,Married to a Mermaid,"There was a gay young farmer,
Who liv'd on Salisbury plain;
He lov'd a rich Knight's daughter dear!
And she lov'd him again.
The Knight he was distressed,
That they should sweethearts be.
So he had the farmer soon pressed,
And sent him off to sea.
Singing Rule Britannia,
Britannia rules the waves
Britons never, never, never shall be slaves...

'Twas on the deep Atlantic,
Midst Equinoctial gales;
This young farmer fell overboard
Among the sharks and whales;
He disappeared so quickly,
So headlong down went he,
That he went out of sight
Like a streak of light
To the bottom of the deep blue sea.
Singing Rule Britannia,
Britannia rules the waves
Britons never, never, never shall be slaves...

We lowered a boat to find him,
We thought to see his corse,
When up to the top he came with a bang,
And sang in a voice so hoarse,
'My comrades and my messmates,
Oh, do not weep for me,
For I'm married to a mermaid,
At the bottom of the deep blue sea.'
Singing Rule Britannia,
Britannia rules the waves
Britons never, never, never shall be slaves...

He said that as he went down,
Great fishes he did see;
They seemed to think as he did wink,
That he was rather free.
But down he went so quickly,
Saying, ''Tis all up with me,'
When he met a lovely mermaid
At the bottom of the deep blue sea.
Singing Rule Britannia,
Britannia rules the waves
Britons never, never, never shall be slaves...

She came at once unto him,
And gave him her white hand,
Saying, 'I have waited long, my dear,
To welcome you to land.
Go to your ship and tell them,
You'll leave them all for me;
For you're married to a mermaid
At the bottom of the deep blue sea.'
Singing Rule Britannia,
Britannia rules the waves
Britons never, never, never shall be slaves...

The wind was fair, the sails set,
The ship was running free;
When we all went to the captain bold,
And told what we did see.
He went unto the ship's side,
And loudly bellowed he,
'Be happy as you can, my man,
At the bottom of the deep blue sea.'
Singing Rule Britannia,
Britannia rules the waves
Britons never, never, never shall be slaves..."
67,The Mermaid,"'Twas Friday morn when we set sail,
And we had not got far from land,
When the Captain, he spied a lovely mermaid,
With a comb and a glass in her hand.
Oh the ocean waves may roll,
And the stormy winds may blow,
While we poor sailors go skipping aloft
And the land lubbers lay down below, below, below
And the land lubbers lay down below.

Then up spoke the Captain of our gallant ship,
And a jolly old Captain was he;
""I have a wife in Salem town,
But tonight a widow she will be.""
Oh the ocean waves may roll,
And the stormy winds may blow,
While we poor sailors go skipping aloft
And the land lubbers lay down below, below, below
And the land lubbers lay down below.

Then up spoke the Cook of our gallant ship,
And a greasy old Cook was he;
""I care more for my kettles and my pots,
Than I do for the roaring of the sea.""
Oh the ocean waves may roll,
And the stormy winds may blow,
While we poor sailors go skipping aloft
And the land lubbers lay down below, below, below
And the land lubbers lay down below.

Then up spoke the Cabin-boy of our gallant ship,
And a dirty little brat was he;
""I have friends in Boston town
That don't care a ha' penny for me.""
Oh the ocean waves may roll,
And the stormy winds may blow,
While we poor sailors go skipping aloft
And the land lubbers lay down below, below, below
And the land lubbers lay down below.

Then three times 'round went our gallant ship,
And three times 'round went she,
And the third time that she went 'round
She sank to the bottom of the sea.
Oh the ocean waves may roll,
And the stormy winds may blow,
While we poor sailors go skipping aloft
And the land lubbers lay down below, below, below
And the land lubbers lay down below."
68,On Board a Ninety-Eight,"When I was young and scarce eighteen,
I drove a roaring trade;
And many a sly trick I have played
On many a pretty maid.
My parents found that would not do,
I soon would spend their store,
So they resolv'd that I should go
On board a Man-of-War.

A bold pressgang surrounded me,
Their warrant they did show,
And swore that I should go to sea,
And face the daring foe.
So off they lugged me to the boat.
O how I cursed my fate,
'Twas then I found that I must float
On board a Ninety-Eight.

When first I put my foot on board,
How I began to stare,
Our Admiral he gave the word,
'There is no time to spare!'
They weighed their anchor, shook out sail,
And off they bore me straight,
To watch the foe in storm and gale,
On board a Ninety-Eight.

Now as time fled I bolder grew,
And hardened was to war;
I'd run aloft with my ship's crew,
And valued not a scar.
So well I did my duty do,
Till I got boatswain's mate,
And damme, soon got boatswain too
On board a Ninety-Eight.

So years rolled by, at Trafalgar
Brave Nelson fought and fell;
As they capsized that hardy tar
I caught a rap as well.
To Greenwich College I came back,
Because I saved my pate;
They only knocked a wing off Jack
On board a Ninety-Eight.

So now my cocoa I can take,
My pouch with 'bacca stored;
With my blue clothes and three-cocked hat
I'm happy as a lord.
I've done my duty, served my king,
And now I bless my fate,
But damme, I'm too old to sing,
I'm nearly ninety -eight."
69,Paul Jones,"It's of an American frigate the ""Richard"" by name
Mounted forty-four guns, and from New York she came.
A-cruising down the channel of Old England's fame
With a noble commander, Paul Jones was his name.

We had not cruised long before two sails we espies
A large forty-four and a twenty likewise,
Some fifty bright shipping, well loaded with store,
And the convoy stood in for the old Yorkshire shore.

'Bout the hour of twelve we came alongside
With a long speaking trumpet: Whence came you? he cried;
Come, answer me quickly, I'll hail you no more
Or else a broadside into you I will pour.

We fought them four glasses, four glasses so hot,
Till forty bold seamen lay dead on the spot,
And fifty-five more lay bleeding in gore,
While the thundering loud cannons of Paul Jones did roar.

Our carpenter being frighten'd, to Paul Jones he came,
Our ship she leaks water and is likewise in flame,
Paul Jones he made answer, and to him replied,
If we can do no better, we'll sink alongside.

Paul Jones he then turned to his men and did say
Let every man stand the best of his play,
For broadside for broadside they fought on the main
Like true buckskin heroes we return'd it again.

The Serapis wore round our ship for to rake,
And many proud hearts of the English did ache;
The shot flew so hot, and so fierce and so fast,
And the bold British colours were hauled down at last.

Oh now, my brave boys, we have taken a rich prize
A large forty-four and a twenty likewise;
To help the poor mothers that have reason to weep
For the loss of their sons in the unfathomed deep."
70,Quare Bungle Rye,"Now Jack was a sailor who roamed on the town.
And she was a damsel who walked up and down.
Said the damsel to Jack as she passed him by,
'Would ye like for to purchase some quare bungle rye raddy rye?'
Fol de diddle rye raddy rye raddy rye.

Thought Jack to himself, 'Now what can this be?'
'But the finest old whiskey from High Germany.
'Smuggled up in a basket and sold on the sly,
'And the name that it goes by is quare bungle rye raddy rye.'
Fol de diddle rye raddy rye raddy rye.

Jack hands her a shilling and he thought nothing strange.
Says she, 'Here hold the basket til I run for your change.'
Jack peeks in the basket and a babe he did spy.
'Why b'damn me,' says Jack, 'this is quare bungle rye raddy rye.'
Fol de diddle rye raddy rye raddy rye.

Now to get the child christened was Jack's first intent,
So to get the child christened to the parson he went.
Says the parson to Jack, 'What's the name he'll go by?'
'Ah b'damn me,' says Jack, 'call 'im quare bungle rye raddy rye.'
Fol de diddle rye raddy rye raddy rye.

Says the parson to Jack, 'That's a mighty quare name.'
'Ah b'damn me,"" says Jack, 'it's a quare way he came;
'Smuggled up in a basket and sold on the sly,
'And the name that he'll go by is Quare Bungle Rye raddy rye.'
Fol de diddle rye raddy rye raddy rye

Now all you young sailors who roam on the town,
Be wary of damsels that walk up and down.
Take a peek in their baskets as they pass you by,
Or else they may pawn on you Quare Bungle Rye raddy rye
Fol de diddle rye raddy rye raddy rye."
71,The Rambling Sailor,"I am a sailor stout and bold,
Long time I've plough'd the ocean;
I've fought for king and country too,
Won honour and promotion.
I said: My brother sailor I bid you adieu,
No more to sea will I go with you;
I'll travel the country through and through,
And I'll be a rambling sailor.

If you should want to know my name,
My name it is young Johnson.
I've got permission from the king
To court young girls and handsome.
I said: My dear, what will you do?
Here's ale and wine and brandy too;
Besides a pair of new silk shoes,
To travel with a rambling sailor.

The king's permission granted me
To range the country over;
From Bristol Town to Liverpool,
From Plymouth Sound to Dover.
And in whatever town I went,
To court young maidens I was bent;
And marry none was my intent,
But live a rambling sailor."
72,Rhyme of the Chivalrous Shark,"Most chivalrous fish of the ocean
To ladies forbearing and mild,
Though his record be dark,
is the man-eating shark,
Who will eat neither woman nor child.

He dines upon seamen and skippers,
And tourists his hunger assuage,
And a fresh cabin boy
will inspire him with joy
If he's past the maturity age.

A doctor, a lawyer, a preacher,
He'll gobble one any fine day,
But the ladies, God bless 'em
He'll only address 'em
Politely and go on his way.

I can readily cite you an instance
Where a lovely young lady of Breem,
Who was tender and sweet
and delicious to eat
Fell into the bay with a scream.

She struggled and flounced in the water,
And signaled in vain for her bar,
And she'd surely been drowned
if she hadn't been found
By a chivalrous man-eating shark.

He bowed in a manner most polished
Thus soothing her impulses wild.
""Don't be frightened,"" he said,
""I've been properly bred,
And will eat neither woman nor child.""

Then her proffered his fin and she took it
Such gallantry none can dispute.
While the passengers cheered
as the vessel they neared
And a broadside was fired in salute.

And they soon stood alongside the vessel,
When a life-saving dinghy was lowered
With the pick of the crew,
And her relatives too
And the mate and the skipper aboard.

So they took her aboard in a jiffy,
And the shark stood attention the while,
Then he raised on his flipper
and ate up the skipper
And went on his way with a smile.

And this shows that the prince of the ocean,
To ladies forbearing and mile,
Though his record be dark
Is the man-eating shark,
Who will eat neither woman nor child."
73,Sir Patrick Spence,"The king sits in Dunfermline toun,
Drinkin' the bluid red wine
'0 whaur will I get a skeely skipper,
To sail this ship o' mine?'

Then up and spak an eldern knicht,
Sat at the king's richt knee,
'Sir Patrick Spence is the best sailor,
That ever sail'd the sea.'

Our king has written a braid letter,
And seal'd it wi' his han',
And sent it to Sir Patrick Spence,
Was walkin' on the stran'.

'To Noroway, to Noroway,
To Noroway owre the faim;
The king's dochter o' Noroway,
It's thou maun bring her hame.'

The first line that Sir Patrick read,
Sae lond, loud laughed he;
The neist line that Sir Patrick read,
The tear blinded his e'e.

'O wha is this has dune this deed,
And tauld the king o' me,
To send us oot at this time o' the year
To sail upon the sea?

Be't wind, be't weet, be't bail, be't sleet,
Our ship maun sail the faim;
The king's dochter o' Noroway,
It's we maun fetch her hame.'

They boys'd their sails on Mononday,
Wi' a' the speed they may;
They hae landed in Noroway
Upon a Wodnesday.

* * * * *

'Mak ready, mak ready, my merry men a',
Our guid ship sails the morn,'
'0 say na sae, my maister dear,
For I fear a deidly storm.

I saw the new moon late yestreen,
Wi' the auld moon in her arm,
And I fear, I fear, my maister dear,
That we will come to harm.

They had na sail'd a league, a leagne,
A league but barely three,
When the lift grew dark, and the wind blew loud,
And gurly grew the sea.

The ankers brak, and the tapmasts lap,
'Twas sic a deidly storm
And the waves cam owre the broken ship,
Till a' her sides were torn.

* * * * *

Gae fetch a wab o' the silken claith,
Anither o' the twine,
And wap them to our guid ship's side,
That the saut sea come na in.

They fetch'd a wab o' the silken claith
Anither o' the twine,
And they wapp'd them round that guid ship's side,
But still the sea cam in!

O laith, laith were our guid Scots lords,
To weet their cork-heel'd shoon;
But lang or a' the play was play'd,
They wat their hats aboon.

And many was the feather bed,
That flauchter'd on the faim;
And mony was the guid lord's son,
That never mair cam hame!

The ladyes wrang their fingers white,
The maidens tore their hair,
A' for the sake o' their true loves,-
For them they'll see nae mair!

O lang, lang may the ladyes sit,
Wi' their fans into their han',
Before they see Sir Patrick Spence
Come sailin' to the stran'!

O lang, lang may time maidens sit,
Wi' their gowd kaims in their hair,
A' waiting for their ain dear loves,-
For them they'll see nae mair!

It's forty miles frae Aberdeen,
And fifty fathoms deep,
And there lies guid Sir Patrick Spence,
Wi' the Sects lords at his feet!"
74,Sir Peter Parker,"My lords with your leave
An account I will give
That deserves to be written in meter
How the rebels and I
Have been pretty nigh
Faith, almost too nigh for Sir Peter.
Ri tu den dio, ri tu den di ay
Faith, almost too nigh for Sir Peter!

With much labor and toil,
Unto Sullivan's Isle,
I came firm as Falstaff or Pistol,
But the Yankees, dod rat'em,
I could not get at 'em,
So terribly mauled my poor Bristol.
Ri tu den dio, ri tu den di ay
So terribly mauled my poor Bristol.

Devil take' em, their shot
Came so swift and so hot
And the cowardly dogs stood so stiff, Sir!
That I put ship about
And was glad to get out
Or they would not have left me a skiff, Sir!
Ri tu den dio, ri tu den di ay
Or they would not have left me a skiff, Sir!

Now Clinton by land
Did quietly stand
While my guns made a terrible rumpus,
But my pride took a fall when a well-aimed ball
Propelled me along on my bumpus!
Ri tu den dio, ri tu den di ay
Propelled me along on my bumpus!

Now bold as a Turk
I sailed for New York,
Where with Clinton and Howe you may find me
I've the wind in my tail
And I'm hoisting my sail,
To leave Sullivan's Island behind me.
Ri tu den dio, ri tu den di ay
To leave Sullivan's Island behind me."
75,The Tarpaulin Jacket,"A tall stalwart lancer lay dying,
And as on his deathbed he lay,
To his friends who around him were sighing,
These last dying words he did say:
Wrap me up in my tarpaulin jacket
And say a poor buffer lies low;
And six stalwart lancers shall carry me
Carry me with steps solemn, mournful and slow.

Had I the wings of a little dove,
Far far away would I fly; I'd fly
Straight for the arms of my true love
And there I would lay me and die.
Wrap me up in my tarpaulin jacket
And say a poor buffer lies low;
And six stalwart lancers shall carry me
Carry me with steps solemn, mournful and slow.

Then get you two little white tombstones
Put them one at my head and my toe, my toe,
And get you a penknife and scratch there:
Here lies a poor buffer below.
Wrap me up in my tarpaulin jacket
And say a poor buffer lies low;
And six stalwart lancers shall carry me
Carry me with steps solemn, mournful and slow.

And get you six brandies and sodas,
And set them all out in a row, a row,
And get you six jolly good fellows
To drink to this buffer below.
Wrap me up in my tarpaulin jacket
And say a poor buffer lies low;
And six stalwart lancers shall carry me
Carry me with steps solemn, mournful and slow.

And then in the calm of the twilight
When the soft winds are whispering low, so low,
And the darkening shadows are falling,
Sometimes think of this buffer below.
Wrap me up in my tarpaulin jacket
And say a poor buffer lies low;
And six stalwart lancers shall carry me
Carry me with steps solemn, mournful and slow."
76,Then Farewell My Tridonotuse-Built Wherry,"Then farewell, my tridonotuse-built wherry,
Oars and coat and badge, farewell!
Never more at Chelsea ferry
Shall your Thomas take a spell.
Then farewell, my tridonotuse-built wherry,
Oars and coat, and badge, farewell;
Never more at Chelsea ferry
Shall your Thomas take a spell,
Shall your Thomas take a spell.

But, to hope and peace a stranger,
In the battle's heat I'll go,
Where, exposed to ev'ry danger,
Some friendly ball shall lay me low.
But, to hope and peace a stranger,
In the battle's heat I'll go,

Then, mayhap, when homeward steering;
With the news my messmates come,
Even you, my story hearing,
With a sigh may cry, 'Poor Tom!'
Then, mayhap, when homeward steering;

77,Three Fishers,"Three fishers went sailing out into the west,
Iout into the west as the sun went down;
Each thought on the woman who lov'd him the best,
And the children stood watching them out of the town;
For men must work, and women must weep,
And there's little to earn, and many to keep,
Though the harbor bar be moaning.

Three wives sat up in the lighthouse tow'r
And they trimmed the lamps as the sun went down;
They looked at the squall, and they looked at the show'r,
And the night-rack came rolling up, ragged and brown.
But men must work, and women must weep,
Tho' storms be sudden and waters deep;
And the harbor bar be moaning.

Three corpses lay out on the shining sands
In the morning gleam as the tide went down,
And the women are weeping and wringing their hands
For those who will never come back to the town;
For men must work,and women must weep,
And the sooner it's over, the sooner to sleep;
And good-bye to the bar and its moaning."
78,Toll for the Brave,"Toll for the Brave!
Brave that are no more,
All sunk beneath the wave;
Fast by their native shore!
Eight hundred of the Brave,
Whose courage well was tried,
Had made the vessel heel,
And laid her on her side,
A land breeze shook the shrouds,
And she was overset,
Down went the Royal George
With all her crew complete.

Toll for the Brave!
The Brave that are no more,
All sunk beneath the wave
Fast by their native shore!

Toll for the Brave!
Brave Kempenfelt is gone;
His last sea fight is fought;
His work of glory done.
It was not in the battle,
No tempest gave the shock,
She sprang no fatal leak,
She ran upon no rock.
His sword was in his sheath,
His fingers held the pen,
When Kempenfelt went down,
With twice four hundred men.

Toll for the Brave!
The Brave that are no more,
All sunk beneath the wave
Fast by their native shore!

Weigh the vessel up,
Once dreaded by our foes,
And mingle with our cup
The tears that England owes.
Her timbers yet are sound,
And she may float again,
Full charg'd with England's thunder,
And plough the distant main.
But Kempenfelt is gone,
His victories are o'er,
And he and his eight hundred
Must plough the wave no more.

Toll for the Brave!
The Brave that are no more,
All sunk beneath the wave
Fast by their native shore!"
79,Tom Bowling,"Here a sheer hulk lies poor Tom Bowling,
The darling of our crew;
No more he'll hear the tempest howling,
For death has broach'd him to:
His form was of the manliest beauty,
His heart was kind and soft.
Faithful, below, he did his duty,
And now he's gone aloft,
And now he's gone aloft.

Tom never from his word departed,
His virtues were so rare,
His friends were many, and true-hearted,
His Poll was kind and fair:
And then he'd sing so blithe and jolly -
Ah! many's the Time and oft -
But mirth is turn'd to melancholy,
For Tom is gone aloft,
For Tom is gone aloft.

Yet shall poor Tom find pleasant weather,
When He, who all commands,
Shall give, to call life's crew together,
The word to pipe all hands:
Thus death, who Kings and tars dispatches,
In vain Tom's life has doff'd,
For though his body's under hatches,
His soul has gone aloft,
His soul has gone aloft."
80,Tom Tough,"My name, d'ye se's Tom Tough, I've see'd a little service,
Where mighty billows roll, and loud tempests blow:
I've sail'd with valiant Howe, I've sail'd with noble Jervis,
And in gallant Duncan's fleet I've sung out Yo! heave ho!
Yet more shall ye be knowing, I was coxen to Boscawen,
And even with brave Hawke have I nobly faced the foe;
Then put round the grog, so we've that on our prog,
We'll laugh in care's face, And sing Yo! heave ho!
We'll laugh in care's face, And sing Yo! heave ho!

When from my love to part, I first weighed anchor,
And she was sniv'lling seen on the beach below;
I'd like to've cotch'd my eyes sniv'lling too,
     d'ye see, to thank her,
But I brought my sorrows up with a Yo! heave ho!
For sailors, tho' they have their jokes,
And love and feel like other folks,
Their duty to neglect must not come for to go;
So I seized the capstan bar, like a true, honest tar,
And in spite of tears and sighs sang out Yo! heave ho!
And in spite of tears and sighs sang out Yo! heave ho!

But the worst was on't was that time
When the little ones were sickly,
And if they'd live or die, the doctor did not know;
The word was gov'd to weigh, so sudden and so quickly,
I thought my heart would break as I sang Yo! heave ho!
For Poll's so like her mother, and as for Jack, her brother,
The boy, when he grows up, will nobly face the foe;
But in Providence I trust, for you see, what must be, must,
So my sighs I gave the wind, and sang out Yo! heave ho!
So my sighs I gave the wind, and sang out Yo! heave ho!

And now at last laid up in a decentish condition,
For I've only lost an eye, and got a timber toe;
But old ships must expect in time, to be out of commission,
Nor again the anchor weigh with a Yo! heave ho!
So I smoke my pipe and Sing old songs;
My boys shall well avenge my wrongs,
And my girls shall have young sailors
Nobly for to face the foe;
Then to Country and Queen, Fate no danger can mean,
While the tars of old England sing out Yo! heave ho!
While the tars of old England sing out Yo! heave ho!"
81,Ward the Pirate,"Come all you gallant seamen bold,
All you that march to drum,
Let's go and look for Captain Ward,
Far on the sea he roams.
He is the biggest robber
That ever you did hear,
there's not been such a robber found
For above this hundred year.

A ship was sailing from the east
And going to the west,
Loaded with silks and satins
And velvets of the best;
But meeting there with Captain Ward,
It was a bad meeting;
He robbed them of all their wealth,
And bid them tell their king.

O then the King proved a ship of noble fame,
She's call'd the Royal Rainbow
If you would have her name;
She was as well provided for
As any ship can be,
Full thirteen hundred men on board
To bear her company.

'Twas eight o'clock in the morning
When they began to fight,
And so they did continue there
Till nine o'clock at night;
Fight on, fight on, says Captain Ward
This sport well pleases me,
For if you fight this month or more,
Your master I will be.

O then the gallant Rainbow, she fired
She fired in vain.
Till six and thirty of her men
All on the deck were slain;
Go home, go home, says Captain Ward
And tell your king for me,
If he reigns king all on the land
Ward will reign king on the sea."
82,We Be Three Poor Mariners,"We be three poor mariners
Newly come from the seas;
We spend our lives in jeopardy
While others live at ease.
Come let us dance the round,
A round, a round
Come let us dance the round,
A round, a round
And he that is a bully boy
Come pledge me on this ground,
A ground, a ground.

We care not for these martial men
That do our states disdain;
But we care for those merchant men
Who do our states maintain.
To them we dance this round,
A round, a round
To them we dance the round,
A round, a round
And he that is a bully boy
Come pledge me on this ground,
A ground, a ground."
83,A Wet Sheet and A Flowing Sea,"A wet sheet and a flowing sea,
A wind that follows fast,
And fills the white and rustling sail,
And bends the gallant mast,
And bends the gallant mast, my boys!
While like an eagle free,
Away the good ship flies,
And leaves Columbia on our lee.
Oh! Give me a wet sheet,
A flowing sea,
And a wind that follows fast,
And fills the white and rustling sail
And bends the gallant mast

Oh, for a soft and gentle wind,
I heard a fair one cry,
But give to me the roaring breeze,
And the white waves heaving high;
And white waves heaving high, my boys!
The good ship tight and free;
The world of waters is our home,
And merry men are we.
Oh! Give me a wet sheet,
A flowing sea,
And a wind that follows fast,
And fills the white and rustling sail
And bends the gallant mast

There's a tempest in yon horned moon,
And lightning in yon cloud,
And hard the music, mariners,
The wind is piping loud;
The wind is piping loud, my boys!
The lightning flashes free,
While the hollow oak our palace is,
Our heritage the sea.
Oh! Give me a wet sheet,
A flowing sea,
And a wind that follows fast,
And fills the white and rustling sail
And bends the gallant mast"
84,Will Watch,"One morn when the wind
from the northward blew keenly,
While sullenly roared
the big waves of the main,
A famed smuggler, Will Watch,
kissed his Sue, then serenely
Took helm, and to sea
boldy steered out again.
Will had promised his Sue
that this trip, if well ended,
Should coil up his ropes,
and he'd anchor to shore;
When his pockets were lined,
why his life should be mended,
The laws he had broken
he'd never break more.

His sea-boat was trim -
made her port - took her lading,
Then Will stood to sea,
reached the offing, and cried,
This night, if I've luck,
furls the sails of my trading.
In dock I can lay -
serve a friend to beside.
He lay to till night
came on darksome and dreary,
To crowd every sail
then he piped up all hands;
But a signal soon spied -
'twas a prospect uncheerly,
A signal that warned him
to bear from the land.

The Philistines are out,
cries Will, we'll take no heed on't,
Attacked, who's the man
that will flinch from his gun?
Should my head be blown off
I shall ne'er feel the need on't,
We'll fight while we can;
when we can't, boys, we'll run.
Thro' the haze of the night
a bright flash now appearing,
Oh ho! cried Will Watch,
the Philistines bear down.
Bear a hand, my tight lads,
ere we think about sheering.
Our broadside pour in
should we swim, boys, or drown.

But should I be popped off,
you, my mates left behind me,
Regard my last words,
see 'em kindly obeyed.
Let no stone mark the spot,
and, my friends, do you mind me,
Near the beach is the grave
where Will Watch should be laid.
Poor Will's yarn was spun out -
for a bullet next minute
Laid him low on the deck
and he never spoke more.
His bold crew fought the brig
while a shot remained in it,
Then sheered, and Will's hulk
to his Susan they bore.

In the dead of the night
his last wish was complied with,
To few known his grave
and to few known his end;
He was borne to the earth
by the crew that he died with;
He'd the tears of his Susan,
the prayers of each friend,
Near his grave dash the billows,
the winds loudly bellow,
Yon ash struck with lightning
point out the cold bed
Where Will Watch, the bold smuggler,
that famed lawless fellow,
Once feared - now forget -
sleeps in peace with the dead."
85,The Yankee Man-of-War,"'Tis of a gallant Yankee ship
That flew the stripes and stars,
And the whistling wind from the west nor'west
Blew through the pitchpine spars,
With her starboard tacks aboard, my boys,
She hung upon the gale; on an autumn night
We raised the light on the old head of Kinsale.

It was a clear and cloudless night,
And the wind blew steady and strong,
As fairly over the sparkling deep
Our good ship bowled along;
With the foaming seas beneath her bow
The fiery waves she spread,
And bending low her bosom of snow,
She buried her lee, cat-head.

There was no talk of short'ning sail,
by him who walked the poop,
And under the press of her pond'ring jib
The boom bent like a hoop!
And the groaning waterways told the strain
That held her stout main tack,
But he only laughed as he glanced aloft
At a white and silv'ry track.

The nightly robes our good ship wore
Were her own topsails three,
Her spanker and her standing jib,
The courses being free;
Now lay aloft! my heroes bold,
Let not a moment pass!
And royals and topgallant sails
Were quickly on each mast.

What looms upon our starboard bow?
What hangs upon the breeze?
'Tis time our good ship hauled her wind
Abreast of the old saltee's.
For by her ponderous press of sail
And by her escorts four,
We saw our morning visitor
Was a British man-of-war.

Up spoke our noble captain then,
And a short ahead of us passed,
Haul snug your flowing courses!
Lay your topsail to the mast!
Those Englishmen gave three loud hurrahs
From the deck of their covered ark
And we answered by a solid broadside
From the deck of our patriot bark.

Out booms! Out booms! our skipper cried,
Out booms! and give her sheet,
And the swiftest keel that ever was launched
Shot ahead of the British fleet,
And amidst a thundering shower of shot
With the stun-sails hoisting away,
Down the north channel Paul Jones did steer
Just at the break of day."
86,Young Edwin in the Lowlands Low,"Come, all you wild, young people
And listen to the song
That I will sing concerning gold,
Which guides so many wrong.
Young Emma was a servant-maid
And loved a sailor bold,
He ploughed the main much gold to gain,
For his Love, as we've been told.

Young Emma she did daily mourn
Since Edwin first did roam;
When seven years were past and gone,
Then Edwin hailed his home.
He went unto young Emma's house
The store of gold to show,
Which he had gained upon the main
Above the Lowlands Low.

Her father kept a public inn,
It stood down by the sea.
Says Emma, 'You can enter in
And there this night can be.
I'll meet you in the morning,
Don't let my parents know,
Your name it is young Edwin
That ploughed the Lowlands Low.'

As Emma she lay sleeping
She had a frightful dream,
She dreamt her Love stood weeping,
His blood poured in a stream.
She rose up in the morning
And to her friends did go,
Because she loved him dearly;
That ploughed the Lowlands Low.

'Oh, mother, where's the stranger lad,
Came here last night to stay?'
'Oh, he is dead, no tales can tell;'
Her father he did say.
'Then father, cruel father,
You will die a public show
For murdering my Edwin,
That ploughed the Lowlands Low.

The fishes of the ocean
Swim o'er my lover's breast,
His body rolls in motion,
I hope his soul at rest,
How cruel were my parents
To prove his overthrow,
And take the gold from one so bold
That ploughed the Lowlands Low.'"
87,Abdul Abulbul Amir,"The sons of the Prophet are brave men and bold
and quite unaccustomed to fear,
But the bravest by far in the ranks of the shah,
Was Abdul Abulbul Amir.

If you wanted a man to encourage the van,
Or harass the foe from the rear,
Storm fort or redoubt, you had only to shout
for Abdul Abulbul Amir.

Now the heroes were plenty and well known to fame
in the troops that were led by the Czar,
And the bravest of these was a man by the name
of Ivan Skavinsky Skavar.

One day this bold Russian, he shouldered his gun
and donned his most truculent sneer,
Downtown he did go where he tred on the toe
of Abdul Abulbul Amir.

""Young man,"" quote Abdul,""has life grown so dull
That you wish to end your career?
Vile infidel know, you have trod on the toe
Of Abdul Abulbul Amir.

So take your last look at the sunshine and brook
And send your regrets to the Czar
For by this I imply, you are going to die,
Count Ivan Skavinsky Skavar.""

Then this bold Mameluke drew his trusty skibouk,
Singing, ""Allah! Il Allah! Al-lah!""
And with murderous intent he ferociously went
for Ivan Skavinsky Skavar.

They parried and thrust, they side-stepped and cussed,
Of blood they spilled a great part;
The philologist blokes, who seldom crack jokes,
Say that hash was first made on the spot.

They fought all that night neath the pale yellow moon;
The din, it was heard from afar,
And huge multitudes came, so great was the fame,
of Abdul and Ivan Skavar.

As Abdul's long knife was extracting the life,
In fact he was shouting, ""Huzzah!""
He felt himself struck by that wily Calmuck,
Count Ivan Skavinsky Skavar.

The Sultan drove by in his red-breasted fly,
Expecting the victor to cheer,
But he only drew nigh to hear the last sigh,
Of Abdul Abulbul Amir.

There's a tomb rises up where the Blue Danube rolls,
And graved there in characters clear,
Is, ""Stranger, when passing, oh pray for the soul
Of Abdul Abulbul Amir.""

A splash in the Black Sea one dark moonless night
Caused ripples to spread wide and far,
It was made by a sack fitting close to the back,
of Ivan Skavinsky Skavar.

A Muscovite maiden her lone vigil keeps,
Neath the light of the cold northern star,
And the name that she murmurs in vain as she weeps,
is Ivan Skavinsky Skavar."
88,Ballad of Ivan Petrofsky Skevar,"The sons of the Prophet are valiant and bold
and wholly impervious to fear,
But the bravest of all was a man by the name,
Of Abdulah Boul Boul Ameer.

If you wanted a man to encourage the van,
Or harass the foe from the rear,
Or to storm a redoubt, you had only to shout
for Abdulah Boul Boul Ameer.

This son of the desert in batle aroused
Could spit twenty men on his spear,
A terrible creature, sober or soused,
Was Abdulah Boul Boul Ameer

There are brave men in plenty, and well known to fame,
in the army that's run by the Czar,
But the bravest of all was a man by the name
of Ivan Petrofsky Skevar.

He cold imitate Irving, tell fortunes by cards,
And play on the Spanish guitar,
In fact quite the cream of the Muscovite team
was Ivan Petrofsky Skevar.

The ladies all loved him, his rivals were few,
He could drink them all under the bar.
As gallant or tank there was no one to rank,
With Ivan Petrofsky Skevar.

One day that bold Russian, he shouldered his gun
and with his most cynical sneer,
Was going down town, when he came right upon
Brave Abdulah Boul Boul Ameer.

""Young man,"" said Boul Boul, ""is existence so dull
That you hanker to end your career?
For infidel know, you have trod on the toe
Of Abdulah Boul Boul Ameer.

So take your last look upon sky, sea, brook
And send your regrets to the Czar
For by this I imply, you are going to die,
O you Ivan Petrofsky Skevar.""

""But your murderous threats are to me but a joke,
For my pleasure and pastime is war
And I'll tread on your toes whene'er I may choose,""
Quoth Ivan Petrofsky Skevar.

Then that brave Mameluke drew his trusty chabook,
Singing, ""Allah! Il Allah! Akbar!""
And with murder intent he ferociously went
at Ivan Petrofsky Skevar.

But the Russian gave back not a step at th' attack,
For Ivan had never known fear,
And with quickly aimed gun, put a stop to the fun,
Of Abdulah Boul Boul Ameer

Yet the whistling chabook did like lighning descend,
And caught Ivan right over the ear.
But the bayonet of Ivan pressed right through the heart
Of Abdulah Boul Boul Ameer.

The Russian commander spurred thither in haste,
To seek fo his favorite Hussar.
Lo, pierced through the snoot from the fatal chabook,
Lay Ivan Petrofsky Skevar.

The sultan rode up the distrubance to quell,
Or to give to the victor a cheer,
But he arrived just in time to take hasty farewell
Of Abdulah Boul Boul Ameer

Then Gotchikoff, Skabeloff, Menchikoff too,
Drove up in the Emperor's car,
But only in time to bid rapid adieu
To Ivan Petrofsky Skevar.

There lieth a stone where the Danube doth roll,
And on it in characters clear,
Is, ""Stranger, remember to pray for the soul
Of Abdulah Boul Boul Ameer.""

A Muscovite maiden her sad vigil keeps,
In her home by the cold northern star,
And the name that she murmurs so oft in her sleep,
is Ivan Petrofsky Skevar."
89,The Crocodile Song,"Come list ye, landsmen, all to me,
To tell the truth I'm bound-
What happened to me by going to sea
And the wonders that I found.
Shipwrecked I was one sappy rouse
And cast all on the shore,
So I resolved to take a cruise,
The country to explore.
To my ri tol tooral loralido,
Ritol looral lay,
To my ri tol lol fol liddle lol de fol
To my tol looral lay.

Oh, I had not long scurried out,
When close alongside the ocean,
'Twas there that I saw something move,
Like all the earth in motion.
While steering close up alongside
I saw it was a crocodile;
From the end of his nose to the tip of his tail
It measured five hundred mile.
To my ri tol tooral loralido,
Ritol looral lay,
To my ri tol lol fol liddle lol de fol
To my tol looral lay.

This crocodile I could plainly see
Was none of the common race,
For I had to climb a very high tree
Before I could see his face.
And when he lifted up his jaw,
Perhaps you may think it a lie,
But his back was three miles through the clouds
And his nose near touched the sky.
To my ri tol tooral loralido,
Ritol looral lay,
To my ri tol lol fol liddle lol de fol
To my tol looral lay.

Oh, up aloft the wind was high,
It blew a hard gale from the south;
I lost my hold and away I flew
Right into the crocodile's mouth.
He quickly closed his jaws on me,
He thought to nab a victim;
But I slipped down his throat, d'ye see,
And that's the way I tricked 'im.
To my ri tol tooral loralido,
Ritol looral lay,
To my ri tol lol fol liddle lol de fol
To my tol looral lay.

I traveled on for a year or two
Till I got into his maw,
And there were rum kegs not a few
And a thousand bullocks in store.
Through life I banished all my care
For on grub I was not stinted;
And in this crocodile lived ten years,
Very well contented.
To my ri tol tooral loralido,
Ritol looral lay,
To my ri tol lol fol liddle lol de fol
To my tol looral lay.

This crocodile being very old,
One day at last he died;
He was three years in catching cold,
He was so long and wide.
His skin was three miles thick, I'm sure,
Or very near about;
For I was full six months or more
In making a hole to get out.
To my ri tol tooral loralido,
Ritol looral lay,
To my ri tol lol fol liddle lol de fol
To my tol looral lay.

So now I'm safe on earth once more,
Resolved no more to roam.
In a ship that passed I got a berth,
So now I'm safe at home.
But, if my story you should doubt,
Did you ever cross the Nile
'Twas there he fell---you'll find the shell
Of this wonderful crocodile.
To my ri tol tooral loralido,
Ritol looral lay,
To my ri tol lol fol liddle lol de fol
To my tol looral lay."
90,Dance to your Daddy,"Dance to your daddy,
My little laddie,
Dance to your daddy,
My little man.
Thou shalt have a fish,
Thou shalt have a fin,
Thou shalt have a haddock
When the boat comes in;
Thou shalt have a codling
Boiled in a pan -
Dance to your daddy,
My little man.

Dance to your daddy,
My little laddie,
Dance to your daddy,
My little lamb.
When thou art a man
And fit to take a wife,
Thou shalt wed a maid
And love her all your life;
She shall be your lassie,
Thou shalt be her man
Dance to your daddy, My little lamb."
91,Poor Old Horse,"When I was young and in my prime
And in my stable lay,
They gave to me the very best corn...
And the choicest hay.
Poor old horse!
Poor old mare!

My master used to ride me out
And tie me to the stile,
And he was courtin the miller's girl
While I could trot a mile.
Poor old horse!
Poor old mare!

Now I am old and done for,
And fit for nothing at all,
I'm forced to eat the sour grass
That grows along the wall.
Poor old horse!
Poor old mare!

Then lay my tott'ring legs so low
That have run very far,
O'er hedges and o'er ditches,
O'er tunrpike gate and bar.
Poor old horse!
Poor old mare!

My hide I'll give to the huntsman,
My shoes I'll throw away;
The dogs shall eat my rotten flesh,
And that's how I'll decay.
Poor old horse!
Poor old mare!"
92,The Sheffield Apprentice,"I was brought up in Sheffield,
But not of high degree;
My parents doted on me,
They had no child but me;
I roamed about for pleasure,
Where'er my fancy led,
Till I was bound apprentice,
Then all my joys were fled.

I did not like my master,
He did not use me well,
I made a resolution
Not long with him to dwell.
A wealthy rich young lady
From London met me there,
And offered me great wages
To serve her for a year.

I had not been in London
Scarce one month, two or three,
Before my honoured mistress
Grew very fond of me,
She said ""I've gold, I've silver,
I've houses and I've land,
If you will marry me
They shall be at your command.""

""0 no, dear honoured mistress
I cannot wed you now,
For I have lately promised
Likewise a solemn vow,
To wed with dearest Polly
Your handsome chambermaid,
Excuse me honoured mistress,
She has my heart betrayed!""

She flew into a passion
And turned away from me,
Resolved within herself
She would be revenged on me;
Her gold ring from her finger,
As she was passing by,
She slipped it in my pocket,
And for it I must die.

For that before the justice,
The justice I was brought,
And there before the justice
I answered for my fault;
Long time I pleaded innocent
But that was all in vain,
She swore so false against me
That I was sent to gaol.

On the day of execution,
All on that fatal day,
I prayed the people round me
""0 pray come pity me.
Don't laugh at my downfall,
For I bid this world adieu;
Farewell my dearest Polly,
I died for love of you!"""
93,Van Diemen's Land,"Come, all you gallant poachers,
That ramble free from care,
That walk out of a moonlight night,
With your dog, your gun, and snare;
Where the lusty hare and pheasant
You have at your command,
Not thinking that your last career
Is on Van Diemen's Land

There was poor Tom Brown from Nottingham,
Jack Williams, and poor Joe,
Were three as daring poachers
As the country well does know;
At night they were trapannÃ¨d
By the keepers hid in sand,
And for fourteen years transported were
Unto Van Diemen's Land.

Oh! when we sailed from England
We landed at the bay,
We had rotten straw for bedding,
We dared not to say nay.
Our cots were fenced with fire,
(we slumber when we can,)
To drive away the wolves and tigers
Upon Van Diemen's Land.

Oh! when that we were landed
Upon that fatal shore,
The planters they came flocking round,
Full twenty score or more;
They ranked us up like horses,
And sold us out of hand,
They yoked us to the plough, my boys,
To plough Van Diemen's Land.

There was one girl from England,
Susan Summers was her name,
For fourteen years transported was,
We all well knew the same;
Our planter bought her freedom,
And he married her out of hand,
Good usage then she gave to us,
Upon Van Diemen's Land.

Oh! oft when I am slumbering,
I have a pleasant dream:
With my sweet girl I am sitting,
Down by some purling stream,
Through England I am roaming,
With her at my command,
Then waken, brokenhearted,
Upon Van Diemen's Land.

God bless our wives and families,
Likewise that happy shore,
That isle of sweet contentment
Which we shall see no more.
As for our wretched females,
See them we seldom can,
There are twenty to one woman
Upon Van Diemen's Land.

Come all you gallant poachers,
Give ear unto my song,
It is a bit of good advice,
Although it is not long:
Lay by your dog and snare;
To you I do speak plain,
If you knew the hardships we endure
You ne'er would poach again."
94,Can of Grog,"When up the shrouds the sailor goes
And ventures on the yard
The landsman who no better know
Believe his lot is hard
Bold Jack with smiles each danger meets
Weighs anchor heaves the log
Trims all the sails belays his sheets
And drinks his can of grog

If to engage they give the word
To quarters he'll repair
Now winding in the dismal flood
Now quivering in the air
When waves 'gainst rocks to rend and roar
You'll n'er hear him repine
Though he's on Greenland's icy shore
Or burning beneath the line

When sailing orders to arrive
Bold Jack he takes his leave
My dear sweetest Pol he cries
I pray now do not grieve
Thy Jack will take his daily can
Of grog and drink to thee
In hopes that thou will n'er forget
Thy sailor who's at sea

But should thou false or fickle prove
To Jack who loves thee dear
No more upon my native shore
Can I with joy appear
But restless as the briny main
Must heartless heave the log
Shall trim the sails and try to drown
My sorrow in cans of grog"

96,Eight Bells,"My husband's a saucy foretop man,
A chum of the cooks, don't you know?
He put his head down the cook's funnel,
And shouted, ""come up from below.""
Eight bells, Eight bells,
Rouse out there the watch from below;
Eight bells, eight bells,
Rouse out there the watch from below.

My husband once shipped in a whaler,
And sailed to the far Northern Seas;
But being a bold-hearted sailor,
He cared not for ice, sea, nor breeze.
Eight bells, Eight bells,
Rouse out there the watch from below;
Eight bells, eight bells,
Rouse out there the watch from below.

At the end of each watch though his fancy
Was to get to his bunk quickly, oh!
For he wanted to dream of his Nancy,
So called to the watch, ""hi below!""
Eight bells, Eight bells,
Rouse out there the watch from below;
Eight bells, eight bells,
Rouse out there the watch from below.

But now he's no longer a sailor
He often wakes up in the night
And thinking he's still on the whaler
Calls out with the greatest delight-
Eight bells, Eight bells,
Rouse out there the watch from below;
Eight bells, eight bells,
Rouse out there the watch from below."
97,Farewell to Grog,"Come, messmates, pass the bottle 'round
Our time is short, remember,
For our grog must stop,
And our spirits drop,
On the first day of September.
For tonight we'll merry, merry be,
For tonight we'll merry, merry be,
For tonight we'll merry, merry be,
Tomorrow we'll be sober.

Farewell old rye, 'tis a sad, sad word
But alas! it must be spoken,
The ruby cup must be given up,
And the demijohn be broken.
For tonight we'll merry, merry be,
For tonight we'll merry, merry be,
For tonight we'll merry, merry be,
Tomorrow we'll be sober.

Jack's happy days will soon be gone,
To return again, oh never!
For they've raised his pay five cents a day,
But stopped his grog forever.
For tonight we'll merry, merry be,
For tonight we'll merry, merry be,
For tonight we'll merry, merry be,
Tomorrow we'll be sober.

Yet memory oft' will backward turn,
And dwell with fondness partial,
On the days when gin was not a sin,
Nor cocktails brought courts-martial.
For tonight we'll merry, merry be,
For tonight we'll merry, merry be,
For tonight we'll merry, merry be,
Tomorrow we'll be sober.

All hands to splice the main brace, call,
But splice it now in sorrow
For the spirit-room key will be laid away
Forever, on tomorrow.
For tonight we'll merry, merry be,
For tonight we'll merry, merry be,
For tonight we'll merry, merry be,
Tomorrow we'll be sober."
98,Sling the Flowing Bowl,"Come, come, my jolly lads, the wind's abaft,
Brisk gales our sails shall crowd;
Then bustle, bustle, boys, haul the boat,
The boatswain pipes aloud.
All hands on board, our ship's unmoored,
The rising gale fills ev'ry sail,
Our ship's well manned and stored.
Then sling the flowing bowl..
Then sling the flowing bowl...
Fond hopes arise, the girls we prize
Shall bless each jovial soul;
Then the can, boys, bring,
We'll drink and sing,
While the foaming billows roll.

Now, to the Spanish coast we're bound to steer.
To see our rights maintained;
The bear a hand, be steady, boys,
Soon we shall see
Old England once again.
From shore to shore
Loud cannons roar,
Our tars shall show the haughty foe
Britannia rules the main.
Then sling the flowing bowl..
Then sling the flowing bowl...
Fond hopes arise, the girls we prize
Shall bless each jovial soul;
Then the can, boys, bring,
We'll drink and sing,
While the foaming billows roll."

100,Rolling Down to Old Maui,"It's a damn tough life full of toil and strife
We whalemen undergo.
And we don't give a damn when the day is done
How hard the winds did blow.
For we're homeward bound from the Arctic ground
With a good ship, taut and free
And we don't give a damn when we drink our rum
With the girls of Old Maui.
Rolling down to Old Maui, me boys
Rolling down to Old Maui
We're homeward bound from the Arctic ground
Rolling down to Old Maui.

Once more we sail with a northerly gale
Through the ice and wind and rain.
Them native maids, them tropical glades,
We soon shall see again.
Six hellish months have passed away
One the cold Kamchatka Sea,
But now we're bound from the Arctic ground
Rolling down to Old Maui.
Rolling down to Old Maui, me boys
Rolling down to Old Maui
We're homeward bound from the Arctic ground
Rolling down to Old Maui.

Once more we sail with a northerly gale
Towards our island home.
Our mainmast sprung, our whaling done,
And we ain't go far to roam.
Our stuns'l bones is carried away
What care we for that sound?
A living gale is after us,
Thank God we're homeward bound.
Rolling down to Old Maui, me boys
Rolling down to Old Maui
We're homeward bound from the Arctic ground
Rolling down to Old Maui.

How soft the breeze through the island trees,
Now the ice is far astern.
Them native maids, them tropical glades
Is a-waiting our return.
Even now their soft brown eyes look out
Hoping some fine day to see
Our baggy sails runnin' 'fore the gales
Rolling down to Old Maui.
Rolling down to Old Maui, me boys
Rolling down to Old Maui
We're homeward bound from the Arctic ground
Rolling down to Old Maui."
101,Rolling Down to Old Mohee,"Once more we are waft by the northern gales
Bounding over the main
And now the hills of the tropic isles
We soon shall see again
Five sluggish moons have waxed and waned
Since from the shore sailed we
Now we are bound from the Arctic ground
Rolling down to old Mohee
Now we are bound from the Arctic ground
Rolling down to old Mohee

Through many a blow of frost and snow
And bitter squalls of hail
Our spars were bent and our canvas rent
As we braved the northern gale
The horrid isles of ice cut tiles
That deck the Arctic sea
Are many many leagues astern
As we sail to old Mohee
Are many many leagues astern
As we sail to old Mohee

Through many a gale of snow and hail
Our good ship bore away
And in the midst of the moonbeam's kiss
We slept in St. Lawrence Bay
And many a day we whiled away
In the bold Kamchatka Sea
And we'll think of that as we laugh and chat
With the girls of old Mohee
And we'll think of that as we laugh and chat
With the girls of old Mohee

An ample share of toil and care
We whalmen undergo
But when it's over what care we
How the bitter blast may blow
We are homeward bound that joyful sound
And yet it may not be
But we'll think of that as we laugh and chat
With the girls of old Mohee
But we'll think of that as we laugh and chat
With the girls of old Mohee"
102,Billy Taylor,"Billy Taylor was a smart young feller
Full of mirth and full of glee,
And he did his mind diskiver
To a lady fair to see.
Fol rol lol, de rol lo lie do
Fol rol lol, de rol lol lay.

Four and twenty smart young fellers,
Dressed were they in blue array,
They came and took poor Billy Taylor
Whom they pressed and sent away
Fol rol lol, de rol lo lie do
Fol rol lol, de rol lol lay.

Soon his true love followed after,
She went by the name of Richard Carr,
And she smeared her lily-white fingers
With the nasty pitch and tar.
Fol rol lol, de rol lo lie do
Fol rol lol, de rol lol lay.

A storm arose upon the ocean,
She went up aloft with the rest,
Her sailor's jacket being unbuttoned
There they diskivered her lily-white breast.
Fol rol lol, de rol lol lay.

When the captain came for to know it
Says he, What wind did blow you here?
Sir, I've come to seek my true love
Whom you've pressed and sent to sea.
Fol rol lol, de rol lo lie do
Fol rol lol, de rol lol lay.

If his name is Billy Taylor
He is both cruel and severe
If you rise up early in the morning
You will see him with his lady dear.
Fol rol lol, de rol lo lie do
Fol rol lol, de rol lol lay.

Early, early, in the morning,
Early at the break of day,
Who did she see but Billy Taylor
Walking with his lady gay.
Fol rol lol, de rol lo lie do
Fol rol lol, de rol lol lay.

Sword and pistols she called out for,
And they came at her command
And she shot her Billy Taylor
With his lady by the hand.
Fol rol lol, de rol lo lie do
Fol rol lol, de rol lol lay.

When the Captain he came for to know it
He applauded her for what she'd done.
And he made her his Lieutenant
Aboard the gallant Thunderbrun."
103,Black-Eyed Susan,"All in the dawn the fleet was moor'd,
The streamers waving to the wind,
When Black-eyed Susan came on board,
Oh where shall I my true love find?
Tell me, ye jovial sailors, tell me true,
If my sweet William, if my sweet William
Sails among your crew?

Oh William, who high upon the yard,
Rocked with the billows to and fro,
Soon as her well-known voice he heard,
He sigh'd and cast his eyes below:
The cord slides swiftly thro' his glowing hands
And as quick as lightning, and as quick as lightning
On the deck he stands.

So sweet the lark, high poised in air,
Shuts close his pinions to his breast,
If, chance, his mate's shrill voice he hear,
And drops at once into her nest:
The noblest captain in the British fleet
Might envy William, might envy William's
Lip those kisses sweet.

'Oh Susan, Susan, lovely dear!
My vows shall ever true remain,
Let me kiss off that falling tear,
We only part to meet again:
Change as ye list, ye winds, my heart shall be
The faithful compass, the faithful compass
That still points to thee.

'Oh, believe not what the landsmen say
Who tempt with doubts thy constant mind,
They'll tell thee sailors when away,
In every port a mistress find:
Yes, yes, believe them when they tell thee so,
For thou art present, for thou art present
Wheresoe'er I go.

If to fair India's coast we sail,
Thy eyes are seen in diamonds bright:
Thy breath is Afric's spicy gale,
Thy skin as ivory so white:
Thus every beauteous object that I view
Wakes in my soul, wakes in my soul
Some charm of lovely Sue.'

Though battle call me from thy arms
Let not my pretty Susan mourn:
Though cannon roar, yet safe from harms
William shall to his dear return:
Love turns aside the balls that round me fly
Lest precious tears, lest precious tears
Should drop from Susan's eye.

The boatswain gave the dreadful word,
Her sails their swelling bosom spread:
No longer can she stay on board -
They kissed, she sighed, he hung his head:
Her lessening boat unwilling rows to land,
'Adieu,' she cries, 'Adieu,' she cries
And waved her lily hand."
104,Blow the Wind Southerly,"Blow the wind Southerly,
Southerly, Southerly,
Blow the wind
South o'er the bonnie blue sea.
Blow the wind Southerly,
Southerly, Southerly
Blow bonnie breeze,
My true lover to me.

They told me last night
There were ships in the offing
And I hurried down
To the deep rolling sea.
But my eye could not see it
Wherever might be it,
The bark that is bearing
My lover to me."
105,A Brisk Young Sailor,"A brisk young sailor came courting me
Until he gained my liberty.
He stole my heart with free good will
And he's got it now, but I love him still.

There is an ale house in yonder town
Where my love goes and he sits him down.
He takes some strange girl on his knees
And he tells her what he does not tell me.

Hard grief for me and I'll tell you why,
Because that she has more gold than I.
her gold will waste, her beauty pass,
And she'll come like me, a poor girl, at last.

I wish to God that my babe was born,
Sat smiling all on its father's knee;
And I in my cold grave was lain
With the green grass growing all over me.

There is a bird all in yonder tree;
Some say he's blind and he cannot see.
I wish it'd been the same by me
Before I'd gain'd my love's company.

The greenest field it shall be my bed.
A flow'ry pillow shall rest my head,
The leaves which blow from tree to tree,
They shall be the coverlets over."
106,"Britons, Strike Home","Come all you bold seamen
And see what is done,
See how a brave woman
Will fight for a man.
So well cross the salt seas,
Let the wind blow so strong,
While our rakish young fellows cry,
Britons, strike home, boys,
Britons, strike home.

My father was a squire,
And I was his heir,
And I fell in love
With a sailor so rare.
So well cross the salt seas,
Let the wind blow so strong,
While our rakish young fellows cry,
Britons, strike home, boys,
Britons, strike home.

The press-gang they took him,
My joy and my pride,
And, dress'd in boy's clothing,
I fought by his side.
So well cross the salt seas,
Let the wind blow so strong,
While our rakish young fellows cry,
Britons, strike home, boys,
Britons, strike home.

Our ship carried
Over nine hundred men,
And out of nine himdred
Five hundred were slain.
So well cross the salt seas,
Let the wind blow so strong,
While our rakish young fellows cry,
Britons, strike home, boys,
Britons, strike home.

The sweet little bullets
Came flying apace,
I was shot in the right breast,
How hard was my case.
So well cross the salt seas,
Let the wind blow so strong,
While our rakish young fellows cry,
Britons, strike home, boys,
Britons, strike home.

My sailor was wounded,
No more could we fight,
Discharged we were married,
So all things came right.
So well cross the salt seas,
Let the wind blow so strong,
While our rakish young fellows cry,
Britons, strike home, boys,
Britons, strike home.

Come all you bold women,
Where'er you may be,
Consider the hardships
We suffer at sea
So well cross the salt seas,
Let the wind blow so strong,
While our rakish young fellows cry,
Britons, strike home, boys,
Britons, strike home."
107,The Drowned Lover,"As I was a walking down in Stokes Bay
I met a drowned sailor on the beach as he lay
And as I drew nigh him, it put me to a stand.,
When I knew it was my own true Love
By the marks on his hand.

As he was a sailing from his own dear shore
Where the waves and the billows so loudly do roar,
I said to my true Love, I shall see you no more
So farewell, my dearest, you're the lad I adore.

She put her arms around him, saying O! My dear!
She wept and she kiss'd him ten thousand times o'er.
O I am contented to lie by thy side.
And in a few moments, this lover she died.

And all in the churchyard these two were laid,
Anda stone for remembrance was laid on her grave,
My joys are all ended, my pleasures are fled,
This grave that I lie in is my new married bed."
108,The Dying Californian,"Lay up nearer, brother, nearer,
For my limbs are growing cold,
And thy presence seemeth nearer
When thine arms around me fold.
I am dying, brother, dying,
Soon you'll miss me in your berth;
For my form will soon be lying,
Beneath the ocean's briny surf.

Tell my father when you see him
That in death I prayed for him
Prayed that I might only meet him
In a world that's free from sin.
Tell my mother, God assist her
Now that she is growing old,
That her child would glad have kissed her
When his lips grew pale and cold.

Listen, brother, catch each whisper
'Tis my wife I speak of now,
Tell, oh tell her how I missed her
When the fever burned my brow.
Tell her she must kiss my children
Like the kiss I last impressed,
Hold them as when last I held them
Held them closely to my breast.

It was for them I crossed the ocean,
What my hopes were I'll not tell;
But they gained an orphan's portion,
Yet He doeth all things well;
Tell them I have reached the haven
Where I sought the precious dust,
And I gained a port called Heaven
Where the gold will never rust."
109,The Fair Sailor Lad,"O the fair sailor lad
He was handsome and free,
And he loved a gentle maid,
And his wife she would be:
""O my fair sailor lad,
Come and bide here wi' me!""
But the fair sailor lad
Sailed away, 'cross the sea.

O the fair sailor lad
He was wae and forlorn:
""I maun see yon gentle maid
From whose side I was torn.
Tho' he sailed that very tide
Her he saw not again,
For that fair sailor lad
Sleeps for aye 'neath the main.

O the fair sailor lad
He was handsome and free,
And he loved a gentle maid,
And his wife she would be:
""O my fair sailor lad,
Come and bide here wi'me!""
But the fair sailor lad
Sleeps alone 'neath the sea."
110,Fair Susan,"Fair Susan I left with my heart full of woe;
I was going my fortune to mend.
And on her soft bosom fell many a tear,
When she parted from her true loving friend.

Farewell! Jack she cried, and she bade me adieu,
And the tears from her eyes they did flow.
From her I did strain with my heart full of pain,
For to join with some Jovial ship's crew.

The wind did blow hard, and the high seas did roar,
Whilst blue lightning around us did fly,
And I thought on my Susan whom I'd left on shore
All alone and in sorrow to cry.

Our ship sprang a leak, and 'twas all hands on deck
Ev'ry man his own life for to save.
I swam on a plank, and got safe from the wreck,
Whilst the rest met a watery grave.

Now, since this good fortune had sav-ed my life,
I took thought to my Susan to go;
I thought for to make her my own lawful wife,
But my Joy was all turn-ed to woe.

Long years did pass by, and my Susan had wed,
Ere some ship to my rescue came nigh.
Oh! afar I will roam, till I'm laid with the dead;
I care nought where my poor body do lie."
111,Farewell to Nova Scotia,"The sun was setting in the west
The birds were singing on every tree
All nature seemed inclined for to rest
But still there was no rest for me.
Farewell to Nova Scotia, you sea-bound coast
Let your mountains dark and dreary be
For when I am far away on the briny ocean tossed
Will you ever heave a sigh and a wish for me?

I grieve to leave my native land
I grieve to leave my comrades all
And my parents whom I held so dear
And the bonnie, bonnie lassie that I do adore.
Farewell to Nova Scotia, you sea-bound coast
Let your mountains dark and dreary be
For when I am far away on the briny ocean tossed
Will you ever heave a sigh and a wish for me?

The drums they do beat and the wars to alarm
The captain calls, we must obey
So farewell, farewell to Nova Scotia's charms
For it's early in the morning I am far, far away.
Farewell to Nova Scotia, you sea-bound coast
Let your mountains dark and dreary be
For when I am far away on the briny ocean tossed
Will you ever heave a sigh and a wish for me?

I have three brothers and they are at rest
Their arms are folded on their breast
But a poor simple sailor just like me
Must be tossed and driven on the dark blue sea.
Farewell to Nova Scotia, you sea-bound coast
Let your mountains dark and dreary be
For when I am far away on the briny ocean tossed
Will you ever heave a sigh and a wish for me?"
112,The Female Smuggler,"O come list a while, and you shall hear,
By the rolling sea lived a maiden fair.
Her father had followed the smuggling trade,
Like a war-like hero.
Like a warlike hero that never was afraid.

Now, in sailor's clothing young Jane did go,
Dressed like a sailor from top to toe
Her aged father was the only care
O this female smuggler.
Of this female smuggler who never did despair.

With her pistols loaded she went aboard.
And by her side hung a glittering sword,
In her belt two daggers; well armed for war
Was this female smuggler,
Was this female smuggler, who never feared a scar.

Now they had not sail-ed far from the land,
When a strange sail brought them to a stand.
'These are sea robbers,' this maid did cry,
'But the female smuggler,
But the female smuggler will conquer or will die.

Alongside, then, this strange vessel came.
Cheer up,' cried Jane, 'we will board the same;
We'll run all chances to rise or fall,'
Cried this female smuggler,
Cried this female smuggler, who never feared a ball.

Now they killed those pirates and took their store,
And soon returned to old Eng-a-land's shore.
With a keg of brandy she walked along,
Did this female smuggler,
Did this female smuggler, and sweetly sang a song.

Now they were followed by the blockade,
Who in irons strong did put this fair maid.
But when they brought her for to be ter-ied,
This young female smuggler,
This young female smuggler stood dress-ed like a bride.

Their commodore against her appeared,
And for her life she did greatly fear.
When he did find to his great surprise
'Twas a female smuggler,
'Twas a female smuggler had fought him in disguise.

He to the judge and the jury said,
'I cannot prosecute this maid,
Pardon for her on my knees I crave,
For this female smuggler,
For this female smuggler so valiant and so brave.'

Then this commodore to her father went,
To gain her hand he asked his consent.
His consent he gained, so the commodore
And the female smuggler,
And the female smuggler are one for evermore."
113,Heavy the Beat of the Weary Waves,"Heavy the beat of the weary waves,
Falling, falling, o'er and o'er upon the rocky shore,
When he comes no more alas! no more!
Och-one! Evermore, Och-one.

Tears of despair from the weeping sky,
Falling to the earth beneath,
And o'er the gloomy heath
Hangs a misty pall of death, of death!
Och-one! Evermore, Och-one!"
114,House Carpenter (English Version),"Well met, well met, my own true love
Well met, well met, cried he
I've just returned from the salt, salt sea
And it's all for the love of thee

O I could have married the king's daughter dear
And she would have married me
But I have refused the crown of gold
And it's all for the sake of thee

If you could have married the king's daughter dear
I'm sure you are to blame
For I am married to the house carpenter
And he is a fine young man

If you'll forsake your house carpenter
And come away with me
I'll take you to where the grass grows green
On the banks of the sweet Willie

If I forsake my house carpenter
And come away with thee
What have you got to maintain me upon
And keep me from slavery


I've six ships sailing on the salt, salt sea
A-sailing from dry land
And a hundred and twenty jolly young men
Shall be at thy command

She picked up her poor wee babe
And kisses gave him three
Saying stay right here with the house carpenter
And keep him good company


They had not been at sea two weeks
I'm sure it was not three
When this poor maid began to weep
And she wept most bitterly


O do you weep for your gold, he said
Your houses, your land, or your store?
Or do you weep for your house carpenter
That you never shall see anymore

I do not weep for my gold, she said
My houses, my land or my store
But I do weep for my poor wee babe
That I never shall see anymore

They had not been at sea three weeks
I'm sure it was not four
When in their ship there sprang a leak
And she sank to rise no more


What hills, what hills are those, my love
That are so bright and free
Those are the hill of Heaven, my love
But not for you and me

What hills, what hills, are those, my love
That are so dark and low
Those are the hills of Hell, my love
Where you and I must go"
115,House Carpenter (Canadian Version),"'Well met, well met, my own true love
And very well met,' said he.
'I have just returned from the salt, salt sea,
And it's all for the sake of thee. '

'I could have married a queen's daughter,
And she would have married me,
But I refused a crown of gold,
And it's all for the sake of thee.'


'If you could have married a queen's daughter,
Then she should have married thee,
For me, young man, you have came too late,
For I've married a house carpenter.'

'If you will leave your house carpenter
And go along with me,
I will take you down where the grass grows green
On the banks of the River Dee.'

'If I were to leave my house carpenter
And go along with thee,
What have you got to maintain a wife
Or to keep her from slavery ?'

'I have seven ships at sea
And seven more in port,
And a hundred and twenty-four jolly, jolly boys,
And they all will wait on thee.'


She called then her two pretty babes
And she kissed them most tenderly,
Saying, 'Stay at home, my two pretty babes'
And bear your own father company.'

She had not sailed on sea two weeks,
I'm sure not sailed on three,
Till here she sat in her new husband's cabin,
Weeping most bitterly.

'Oh, do you weep for gold ?' he said,
'Or do you weep for fear?
Or do you weep for your house carpenter
That you left when you came here ?'


'I do not weep for gold,' she said,
'Nor do I weep for fear,
But I do weep for my two pretty babes
That I left when I came here.'

She had not sailed on sea three weeks,
I'm sure not sailed on four,
Till overboard her fair body she threw
And her weeping was heard no more.

Her curse did attend a sea sailor's life,
Her curse did attend a sailor's life,
For the robbing of a house carpenter,
And stealing away his wife."
116,I Must Live All Alone,"As I was a-walking one morning by chance;
I heard a maid making her moan,
I asked why she sighed, and she sadly replied
'Alas! I must live all alone, alone,
Alas! I must live all alone.'

I said, 'My fair maid, pray whence have you strayed?
And are you some distance from home?'
'My home,' replied she, 'is a burden to me,
For there I must live all alone, alone,
For there I must live all alone.

When I was eleven, sweethearts I had seven,
And then I would look upon none;
But now all in vain I must sigh and complain,
For my true love has left me alone, alone,
For my true love has left me alone.

Oh! come back from sea, my dear Johnny, to me,
And make me a bride of your own!
Or else for your sake my poor heart it will break,
And here I shall die all alone, alone,
And here I shall die all alone."
117,Jackaroe,"There was a wealthy merchant,
In London he did dwell
He had a lovely daughter,
The truth to you I'll tell
Oh the truth to you I'll tell

She had sweethearts a-plenty
And men of high degree
There was none but Jack the sailor,
Her true love e'er could be
Oh her true love e'er could be

Now Jackie's gone a-sailing
With trouble on his mind
To leave his native country
And his darling girl behind
Oh, his darling girl behind.

She went into a tailor shop
And dressed in men's array
And stepped on board a vessel
To convey herself away
Oh, to convey herself away.

""Before you step on board, sir,
Your name I'd like to know""
She smiled all in her countenance,
""They call me Jackaroe""
Oh, they call me Jackaroe.

""Your waist is light and slender,
Your fingers are neat and small
Your cheeks too red and rosy
To face the cannonball""
Oh, to face the cannon-ball.

""I know my waist is slender,
My fingers neat and small
But it would not make me tremble
To see ten thousand fall""
Oh, to see ten thousand fall.

The war soon being over,
They hunted all around
And among the dead and dying
Her darling boy she found
Oh, her darling boy she found.

She picked him up all in her arms
And carried him to the town
And sent for a physician who
Quickly healed his wounds
Oh, who quickly healed his wounds.

This couple they got married
And well they did agree
This couple they got married,
So why not you and me
Oh, so why not you and me."
118,The Keeper of the Eddystone Light,"My father was the keeper of the Eddystone light
And he slept with a mermaid one fine night
Out of this union there came three
A porpoise and a porgy and the other was me!
Yo ho ho, the wind blows free,
Oh for the life on the rolling sea!

One night, as I was a-trimming the glim
Singing a verse from the evening hymn
I head a voice cry out an ""Ahoy!""
And there was my mother, sitting on a buoy.
Yo ho ho, the wind blows free,
Oh for the life on the rolling sea!

""Oh, what has become of my children three?""
My mother then inquired of me.
One's on exhibit as a talking fish
The other was served in a chafing dish.
Yo ho ho, the wind blows free,
Oh for the life on the rolling sea!

Then the phosphorus flashed in her seaweed hair.
I looked again, and my mother wasn't there
But her voice came angrily out of the night
""To Hell with the keeper of the Eddystone Light!""
Yo ho ho, the wind blows free,
Oh for the life on the rolling sea!"
119,The Lass That Loves A Sailor,"The moon on the ocean
Was dimmed by a ripple
Affording a chequered delight;
The gay jolly tars
Passed a word for the tipple,
And the toast -
For 'twas Saturday night:
Some sweetheart or wife
He loved as his life
Each drank, and wished
He could hail her:
But the standing toast
That pleased the most,
Was 'The wind that blows,
The Ship that goes,
And the lass that loves a sailor!'

Some drank 'The Queen,'
And some her brave ships,
And some 'The Constitution';
Some 'May our foes,
And all such rips,
Yield to English resolution!'
That fate might bless
Some Poll or Bess,
And that they soon
Might hail her:
But the standing toast
That pleased the most,
Was 'The wind that blows,
The Ship that goes,
And the lass that loves a sailor!'

Some drank 'The Prince,'
And some 'Our Land,'
This glorious land of freedom!
Some that our tars
May never stand
For heroes brave to lead them!
That she who's in distress may find,
Such friends as ne'er will fail her.
But the standing toast
That pleased the most,
Was 'The wind that blows,
The Ship that goes,
And the lass that loves a sailor!'"
120,The Little Lowland Maid,"It's of a pretty sailor lad
Who ploughed the stormy sea,
He dressed himself in tarry clothes,
Like one in poverty;
His pockets being well lined,
Though of the sailor trade,
For to try the heart of Mary Ann,
The little Lowland Maid.

As Mary Ann was standing
Down by her cottage door
She frowned upon her sailor lad,
Who seemed to be so poor.
She looked just like a goddess,
In jewels rich arrayed,
But the thorn was in the bosom
Of the little Lowland Maid.

'Good morning;' said false Mary Ann,
'I'm glad to meet with you;
Have you forgot your own true love,
Or changed your love for new?
Or is your inclination all
On some other strayed?
So begone!' said lovely Mary Ann,
The little Lowland Maid.

She seemed to be so scornful,
So the sailor says 'Behold!'
All from his trousers-pocket he
Pulls a bag of gold.
So then replied false Mary Ann
'Excuse me what I said!
You're welcome to the cottage and
The little Lowland Maid.'

'Oh no! deceitful damsel,
Your falseness shall be paid,
For I can lie till morning in
Some distant barn or shed.'
It was the hour of twelve oclock
Young Mary Ann did stray,
And she told some other comrade
Where the sailor he did lay.

They went with their dark lanterns
And daggers in their hands,
They rode through woods and meadows,
And past the muddy lands;
'Cheer up your hearts' said Mary Ann,
'and do not be betrayed,
We will rob and slay the sailor for
The little Lowland Maid.'

They both then plunged their daggers
Into the sailor, deep;
They robbed him of his glittering gold,
And left him there to weep.
A gamekeeper was watching them;
All from his wood he strayed,
Then he swore against the villain and
The little Lowland Maid.

They both then stood their trials,
And were condemned, and cast;
And on the fatal gallows-tree
They both were hung at last.
There were thousands flocked to see them,
And scornfully they said
'Begone! you cruel monster, and
The little Lowland Maid!'"
121,Lovely Molly,"Fare you well, lovely Molly, I am going to leave you
And to the East Indies my course I will steer
Don't let my long absence be a bother to you, dear
For we will be married, you need never fear.

Like some jolly little seaman I'll dress and go with you
And in the midst of all danger I'll stand as your friend
Those cold wintry winds, love, around you be blowing
And I will be there for to wait on you then.

Those pretty little hands, love, could not stand a
      rough tackling
Those pretty little feet to the top could not go
Those cold wintry winds you could not endure them
So stay at home, darling, to the seas do not go.

Those two lovers parted, they had kissed plenty
The tears from her eyes down in fountains did pour
Her lily-white hands on the deck she kept wringing
Saying, ""Fare you well, darling, I'll never see you more.""

As I was walking the streets of Philadelphia
Strangee thoughts of my darling came into my mind
I thought on the days, love, that we spent in courting
But the salt seas have parted us now for a time.

Don't let my long absence be a bother to you, dear
Don't let my long journey cause you any pain
Although we are parted I will be true hearted
And I will return in the springtime again."
122,Mary's Dream,"The moon had climb'd the highest hill
Which rises o'er the source of Dee,
And from the eastern summit shed
Her silver light on tow'r and tree;
When Mary laid her down to sleep,
Her thoughts on Sandy far at sea;
When soft and low, a voice was heard,
Say, Mary weep, no more for me!

She from her pillow gently raised
Her head, to ask who there might be,
And saw young Sandy shivering stand,
With visage pale, and hollow e'e.
O Mary dear, cold is my clay;
It lies beneath a stormy sea.
Far, far from thee, I sleep in death,
So, Mary, weep no more for me!

Three stormy nights and stormy days,
We toss'd upon the raging main;
And long we strove our bark to save,
But all our striving was in vain.
Even then, when horror chill'd my blood,
The storm is past, and I at rest;
So, Mary, weep no more for me!

O, maiden dear, thyself prepare;
We soon shall meet upon that shore
Where love is free from doubt and care,
And thou and I shall part no more!
Loud crow'd the cock, the shadow fled;
No more of Sandy could she see:
But soft the passing spirit said:
Sweet Mary, weep no more for me!"
123,Miss Bailey's Ghost,"A Captain bold in Halifax,
Who dwelt in country quarters,
Seduced a maid who hanged herself
One morning in her garters,
His wicked conscience smited him,
He lost his stomach daily,
He took to drinking turpentine
And thought upon Miss Bailey.
Oh, Miss Bailey, unfortunate Miss Bailey,
Oh, Miss Bailey, unfortunate Miss Bailey,

One night, betimes he went to bed,
For he had caught a fever,
Said he, ""I am a handsome man
And I'm a gay deceiver.""
His candle just at twelve o'clock
Began to burn quite palely,
A ghost stepped up to his bedside
And said, ""Behold! Miss Bailey.""
Oh, Miss Bailey, unfortunate Miss Bailey,
Oh, Miss Bailey, unfortunate Miss Bailey,

""Avaunt, Miss Bailey,"" then he cried,
""You can't fright me really.""
""Dear Captain Smith,"" the ghost replied,
""You've used me ungenteelly.
The Coroner's quest was hard with me
Because I've acted frailly,
And parson Biggs won't bury me
Though I'm a dead Miss Bailey.""
Oh, Miss Bailey, unfortunate Miss Bailey,
Oh, Miss Bailey, unfortunate Miss Bailey,

""Dear Ma'am,"" said he, ""since you and I
Accounts must once for all close,
I have a one pound note in my
Regimental small clothes.
'Twill bribe the Sexton for your grave.""
The ghost then vanished gaily,
Crying, ""Bless you wicked Captain Smith,
Remember poor Miss Bailey.""
Oh, Miss Bailey, unfortunate Miss Bailey,
Oh, Miss Bailey, unfortunate Miss Bailey,"
124,Nancy Lee,"Of all the wives as e'er you know,
Yeo ho! lads, ho! Yeo ho! Yeo ho!
There's none like Nancy Lee, I trow,
Yeo ho! Yeo ho! Yeo ho!
See there she stands and waves her hands
Upon the quay, and every day
When I'm away she'll watch for me,
And whisper low when tempests blow,
For Jack at sea,
Yeo ho! lads, ho! Yeo ho!

Chorus
The sailor's wife the sailor's star shall be,
Yeo ho! We go across the sea;
The sailor's wife the sailor's star shall be,
The sailor's wife his star shall be!

The harbor's past, the breezes blow,
Yeo ho! lads, ho! Yeo ho! Yeo ho!
'Tis long ere we come back, I know,
Yeo ho! Yeo ho! Yeo ho!
But true and bright from morn till night
My home will be, and all so neat,
And snug and sweet, for Jack at sea;
And Nancy's face to bless the place,
And welcome me;
Yeo ho! lads, ho! Yeo ho!

Chorus

The bosun pipes the watch below,
Yeo ho! lads, ho! Yeo ho! Yeo ho!
Then here's a health afore we go,
Yeo ho! Yeo ho! Yeo ho!
A long, long life to my sweet wife,
And mates at sea, and keep our bones
From Davy Jones, where-e'er we be,
And may you meet a mate as sweet
As Nancy Lee.
Yeo ho! lads, ho! Yeo ho!

Chorus"
125,The Nightingale,"One morning, one morning, one morning in May
I spied a young couple all on the highway
And one was a lady so bright and so fair
And the other was a soldier, a brave volunteer

Good morning, good morning, good morning to thee,
Now where are you going my pretty lady?
I'm going to travel to the banks of the sea
To see the waters gliding, hear the nightingales sing.

They hadn't been there but an hour or two
Till out of his knapsack a fiddle he drew
The tune that he played caused the vallies to ring.
O harken, says the lady, how the nightingales sing.

Pretty lady, pretty lady, 'tis time to give o're.
O no, pretty soldier, please play one tune more.
I'd rather hear your fiddle at the touch of one string
Than to see the waters gliding, hear the nightingales sing.

Pretty soldier, pretty soldier, will you marry me?
O no, pretty lady that never can be.
I've a wife back in London and children twice three.
Two wives in the army is too many for me."
126,Our Ship She Lies in Harbour,"'Our ship she lies in harbour,
Just ready to set sail,
May heaven be your guardian, love,
Till I return from sea!'

Said the father to the daughter,
'What makes you so lament?
Is there no man in all the world
Could give your heart content?'

Said the daughter to the father,
'I'll tell [you] the reason why:
You have sent away that sailor-lad
That could me satisfy.'

If thats your inclination;
The father did reply,
'I wish he may continue there,
And on the seas may die!'

She, like an angel weeping,
On the rocks sighed every day,
Awaiting for her own true love
Returning home from sea.

'Oh, yonder sits my angel!
She's waiting there for me,
To-morrow to the church we'll go,
And married we will be.'

When they had been to church,
And were returning back again,
She espied her honoured father
And several gentlemen.

Said the father to the daughter,
'Five hundred pounds I'll give,
If you'll forsake that sailor-lad
And come with me to live.'

'It's not your gold that glittered,
Nor yet your silver that shined;
For I'm married to the man I love
And I'm happy in my mind!'"
127,Poor Sally Sits A-Weeping,"Poor Sally sits a-weeping
Down by the seaside,
Poor Sally sits a-weeping
Down by the seaside.
What ails my pretty jewel?
What heart's pain so cruel?
What ails my pretty jewel,
That do cause her for to cry?

Oh! I am uneasy
And troubled in mind,
Oh! I am uneasy
And troubled in mind.
Here's no joy nor pleasure,
Here's sorrow none can measure,
Here's no joy nor pleasure
In this world can I find.

Now once had I a sweetheart,
But now have I none,
Now once had I a sweetheart,
But now have I none.
He's gone and he's leaved me,
He's gone, he's deceived me,
He's gone and he's leaved me
In sorrow for to mourn.

If he had but a-loved me,
As he did pretend,
If he had but a-loved me,
As he did pretend,
He never would have leaved me,
Nor never have deceived me,
He never would have leaved me
Until my life's end.

Oh! it's I will go seek him
Since he's gone from me,
Oh! it's I will go seek him
Since he's gone from me.
A ship, love, I will enter,
My sweet life I'll venture,
A ship, love, I will enter,
And cross the salt sea.

Here's a bunch of blue ribbon
I'll wear for his sake,
Here's a bunch of blue ribbon
I'll wear for his sake;
And that shall be my mourning,
My mourning, my mourning,
And that shall be my mourning
Till death me do take."
128,The Pretty Ploughboy,"It's of a pretty ploughboy, stood gazing over his team
Where his horses stood underneath the shade,
The wild youth goes whistling, goes whistling to his plough,
And by chance he used to meet a pretty maid.
A pretty maid, and by chance he used to meet a pretty maid.

If I should fall in love with you, it's my pretty maid,
And when your parents came for to know
The very first thing will be, they will send me to the sea;
They will send me in the wars to be slain!
To be slain, they will send me in the wars to be slain!

Now when her aged parents they came for to know,
The ploughboy was ploughing on the plain.
The press-gang was sent and they pressed her love away
And they sent him in the wars to be slain.
To be slain, and they sent him in the wars to be slain.

'Twas early the next morning when she early rose,
With her pockets well lined with gold.
See how she traced the streets, with the tears all in her eyes,
In search of her jolly ploughboy bold.
Her jolly poughboy bold, in search of her jolly ploughboy bold.

The very first she met was a brisk young sailor bold.
Have you seen my pretty ploughboy? 0 she cried.
He's gone unto the deep, he's a-sailing in the fleet,
Will you ride, pretty maid, will you ride?
Will you ride, will you ride, pretty maid, will you ride?

She rode till she came to the ship her love was in,
Then unto the captain did complain.
Said she I've come to seek for my pretty ploughboy
That is sent to the wars to be slain.
To be slain, that is sent to the wars to be slain.

She took out fifty guineas and trotted them on the floor
And gently she told them all o'er,
And when she'd got her ploughboy all safe in her arms
Then she rowed the pretty ploughboy safe on shore.
Safe on shore, then she rowed the pretty ploughboy safe on shore."
129,Tarry Trousers,"Yonder stands a pretty maiden,
Who she is I do not know,
I'll go court her for her beauty,
Let her answer yes or no.

'Pretty maid, I've come to court you,
If your favour I do gain
And you make me hearty welcome,
I will call this way again.'

'Sit you down, you're heart'ly welcome,
Sit you down and chat a while,
Sit you down, you're heart'ly welcome,
Suppose you do not call again?'

'Pretty little maid, I've gold and riches,
Pretty little maid, I've houses and lands,
Pretty little maid, I've worldly treasures.
And all will be at your command.'

'What do I care for your worldly treasures?
What do I care for your houses and lands?
What do I care for your gold and riches?
All that I want is a nice young man.'

'Why do you dive so deep in beauty?
It is a flower will soon decay,
It's like the rose that blooms in summer
When winter comes, it fades away.'

'My love wears the tarry trousers,
My love wears the jacket blue,
My love ploughs the deep blue ocean,
So, young man, be off with you.'"
130,The Token,"The breeze was fresh, the ship was in stays,
Each breaker hush'd, the shore a haze,
When Jack, no more on duty call'd
His true love's tokens over haul'd;
The broken gold, the braided hair,
The tender motto, writ so fair,
Upon his 'bacco box he views,
Upon his 'bacco box he views,
Nancy the poet, love the muse,
If you loves I.... as I loves you,
No pair so happy as we two.

The storm, that like the shapeless wreck
Had strew'd with rigging all the deck,
That tars for sharks had giv'n a feast,
And left the ship a hulk had ceas'd:
When Jack, as with his messmates dear.
He shar'd the grog their hearts to cheer,
Took from his 'bacco box a quid,
And spell'd for comfort on the lid,
If you loves I.... as I loves you,
No pair so happy as we two.

The battle - that with horror grim
Had madly ravag'd life and limb,
Had scupper drenched with human gore
And widow'd many a wife - was o'er:
When Jack to his companions dear
First paid the tribute of a tear;
Then, as his 'bacco-box he held,
Restor'd his comfort as he spelled-
If you loves I.... as I loves you,
No pair so happy as we two.

The voyage, - that had been long and hard,
But that had yielded full reward,
And bought each sailor to his friend
Happy and rich - was at an end:
When Jack, his toils and perils o'er,
Beheld his Nancy on the shore:
He then the 'bacco box display'd,
And cried, and seized the yielding maid,
If you loves I.... as I loves you,
No pair so happy as we two."
131,The Valiant Lady,"It's of a brisk young lively lad
Came out of Gloucestershire,
And all his full intention was
To court a lady fair.
Her eyes they shone like morning dew,
Her hair was fair to see;
She was grace,
In form and face,
And was fixed in modesty.

This couple was a-walking,
They loved each other well;
And someone heard them talking
And did her father tell,
And when her father came to know
And understand this thing,
Then said he
'From one like thee
I'll free my daughter in the spring!'

'Twas in the spring-time of the year
There was a press begun;
And all their full intention was
To press a farmer's son.
They pressed him, and sent him out
Far o'er the raging sea,
'where I'm sure
He will no more
Keep my daughter company!

In man's apparel then she did
Resolve to try her fate;
And in the good ship where he rid
She went as surgeon's mate.
Says she 'My soldier shall not be
Destroyed for want of care;
I will dress,
And I will bless,
Whatsoever I endure!

The twenty-first of August
There was a fight begun,
And foremost in the battle
They placed the farmer's son.
He there received a dreadful wound
That struck him in the thigh,
Every vein
Was filled with pain,
He got wounded dreadfully.

Into the surgeon's cabin
They did convey him straight,
Where, first of all the wounded men,
The pretty surgeon's mate
Most tenderly did dress his wound,
Which bitterly did smart;
Then said he
'Oh! one like thee
Once was mistress of my heart!

She went to the commander
And offered very fair:
'Forty or fifty guineas
Shall buy my love quite clear!
No money shall be wanted,
No longer tarry here!'
'Since 'tis so
Come, let's go!
To old England we will steer!'

She went unto her father's gate
And stood there for a while;
Said he 'The heavens bless you!
My own and lovely child!;'
Cried she 'Since I have found him,
And brought him safe to shore,
Our days we'll spend
In old England,
Never roam abroad no more!'"
132,White Wings,"Sail! home, as straight as an arrow,
My yacht shoots along on the crest of the sea;
Sail! home, to sweet Maggie Darrow,
In her dear little home
She is waiting for me.

High up! where cliffs they are craggy
There's where, the girl of my heart waits for me
Heigh! ho, I long for you, Maggie
I'll spread out my ""White Wings""
And sail home to thee.

Yo! ho, how we go!
Oh! how the winds blow!
""White Wings"" they never grow weary,
They carry me cherrily over the sea.
Night comes, I long for my dearie,
I'll spread out my ""White Wings""
And sail home to thee."
133,William and Mary,"As William and Mary walked by the sea-side,
Their last farewell to take,
Should you never return, young William, she said,
My poor heart will surely break.

Be not thus dismayed, young William he said,
As he pressed the dear maid to his side,
Nor my absence don't mourn, for when I return,
I will make little Mary my bride.

Three years passed away without news, when at last,
As she sat at her own cottage door,
An old beggar came by with a patch on his eye,
Quite lame, and pity did implore;

If you're charity you'll bestow, said he,
I will tell you your fortune beside,
The lad that you mourn will never return
To make little Mary his bride.

Mary started and trembled, O tell me, she cried,
All the money I've got I will give,
To what I ask you, if you will tell me true,
Only say, my dear William live?

In poverty he lives, said he,
And shipwreck'd he has been beside,
And return will no more, because he is poor,
To make little Mary his bride

That he lives, Heaven knows the great joy that I feel,
Yet still his misfortunes I mourn,
For he'd been welcome to me in poverty,
In his blue jacket tattered and torn.

For I love him so dear, so true and sincere,
That no other I swear beside,
If in riches he roll'd, and was clothed in gold,
Should make little Mary his bride.

The patch from his eye the beggar then threw,
His old coat and his crutch too beside,
With cheeks like a rose, and in jacket so blue,
'Twas William stood by Mary's side.

Forgive me, dear maid, then William he said,
Your love it was only I tried,
To church let's away, for ere the sun sets,
I'll make little Mary my bride."
134,William Taylor,"William Taylor was a brisk young sailor,
He who courted a lady fair;
Bells were ringing, sailors singing,
As to church they did repair.

Thirty couple at the wedding;
All were dress'd in rich array;
'Stead of William being married,
He was press'd and sent away.

She dress'd up in man's apparel,
Man's apparel she put on;
And she follow'd her true lover;
For to find him she is gone.

Then the Captain stepp'd up to her,
Asking her: What's brought you here?
I am come to seek my true love,
Whom I lately loved so dear.

If you've come to see your true love,
Tell me what his name may be.
O, his name is William Taylor,
From the Irish ranks came he.

You rise early tomorrow morning,
You rise at the break of day;
There you'll see your true love William
Walking with a lady gay.

She rose early the very next morning,
She rose up at the break of day;
There she saw her true love William;
Walking with a lady gay.

Sword and pistol she then order'd
To be brought at her command;
And she shot her true love William,
With the bride on his right arm.

If young folks in Wells or London
Were served the same as she served he,
Then young girls would all be undone,
Very scarce young men would be!"
135,Anchors Aweigh,"Stand Navy down the field
Sails set to the sky,
We'll never change our course,
So Army you steer shy-y-y-y
Roll up the score Navy
Anchor's Aweigh,
Sail Navy down the field

Version 2

Stand Navy out to sea,

On seven seas we learn
Navy's stern call:
Faith, Courage, Service true,

136,Botany Bay (Version 1),"Come, all young men of learning good,
A warning take by me.
I'll have you quit night walking
And shun bad company;
I'll have you quit night walking
Or else you'll rue the day,
And you will be transported
And go to Botany Bay.

I was brought up in London town,
A place I knew full well;
Brought up by honest parents,
The truth to you I'll tell.
Brought up by honest parents,
Who loved me tenderly,
Till I became a roving blade
To prove my destiny.

My character was taken,
And I was sent to gaol.
My parents tried to clear me
But nothing would prevail.
'Twas at our Rutland sessions
The Judge to me did say:
The Jury's found you guilty,
You must go to Botany Bay.

To see my poor old father
As he stood at the bar;
Likewise my dear old mother
Her old gray locks she tore.
And in tearing of her old gray locks
These words to me she did say:
O son! O son! What hast thou done?
Thou art bound for Botany Bay."
