It's the sailboat Malarkey.
Tell me now what is this good boat's name.
It's the sailboat Malarkey.
Well now me boys we are bound out to sea.
In the sailboat Malarkey.
A windward Caroline come down to me.
It's the sailboat Malarkey.
She's lovely aloft and she's lovely below.
Is the sailboat Malarkey
But she's best on the back as you very well know.
In the sailboat Malarkey.
Away, away in Saint George's town.
In the sailboat Malarkey.
The rats come batting the houses down.
Ooh that sailboat Malarkey.
I give them all boys and all that i know**.
In the sailboat Malarkey.
To turn into row with me loosely-o.**
In the sailboat Malarkey.
Yer pick 'er up boys and lay 'er down.
In the sailboat Malarkey.
And hang out tight as she bounces around.
In the sailboat Malarkey."

Lowlands, Lowlands, away, my John.
My love she came dressed all in white,
My Lowlands away.
I dreamed my love came in my sleep,
Lowlands, Lowlands, away, my John.
Her cheeks were wet, her eyes did weep. My Lowlands away.
She came to me at my bed-side,
Lowlands, Lowlands, away, my John.
All dressed in white like some fair bride.
My Lowlands away.
And bravely in her bosom fair,
Lowlands, Lowlands, away, my John.
A red, red love did my love wear.
My Lowlands away.
She made no sound-no word she said,
Lowlands, Lowlands, away, my John.
And then I knew my love was dead.
My Lowlands away.
I bound the weeper round my head,
Lowlands, Lowlands, away, my John.
For now I knew my love was dead.
My Lowlands away.
She waved her hand-she said goodbye,
Lowlands, Lowlands, away, my John.
I wiped the tear from out my eye.
My Lowlands away.
And then awoke to hear the cry,
Lowlands, Lowlands, away, my John.
'Oh, watch on
deck, oh, watch ahoy!'
My Lowlands away."

We'll back up our topsails and heave our vessel to;
Blow high! Blow low! and so sailed we.
For we have got some letters to be carried home by you.
A sailing down all on the coasts of High Barbary
For broadside, for broadside they fought all on the main;
Blow high! Blow low! and so sailed we. 
Until at last the frigate shot the pirate's mast away.
A sailing down all on the coasts of High Barbary
With cutlass and gun, O we fought for hours three;

Held together with bits of twine

Nothing in the galley—nothing in the hold,
But the skipper's turned in with a bag of gold.
""Chorus""
Off Orford Ness she sprang a leak,
Hear her poor old timbers creak.
""Chorus""
We pumped our way round Lowestoft Ness,
When the wind backed round to the west-sou'-west.

Into the Humber and up the town,
Pump you blighters—pump or drown.

29,Way Me Susiana,"We'll heave him up and away we'll go
('Way, me Susiana!)
That is where the cocks do crow
(We're all bound over the mountain)
An' when the cocks begin to crow
('Way, me Susiana!)
'Tis time for me to roll an' go
(We're all bound over the mountain)
And if we drown while we are young
('Way, me Susiana!)
It's better to drown than to wait to be hung
(We're all bound over the mountain)
Oh, growl ye may but go ye must
('Way, me Susiana!)
If ye growl too hard yer head they'll bust
(We're all bound over the mountain)
Up sox, you cocks, hand her two blocks
('Way, me Susiana!)
And go below to yer ol' ditty box
(We're all bound over the mountain)
Oh, rock and shake 'er, one more drag
('Way, me Susiana!)
Oh, bend yer duds an' pack yer bag
(We're all bound over the mountain)"
30,"Leave Her, Johnny","I thought I heard the Old Man say:
""Leave her, Johnny, leave her.""
Tomorrow you will get your pay,
and its time for us to leave her.
Leave her, Johnny, leave her!
Oh, leave her, Johnny, leave her!
For the voyage is long and the winds don't blow
And it's time for us to leave her.
Oh, the wind was foul and the sea ran high
Leave her, Johnny, leave her!
She shipped it green and none went by.
And it's time for us to leave her.
Leave her, Johnny, leave her!
Oh, leave her, Johnny, leave her!
For the voyage is long and the winds don't blow
And it's time for us to leave her.
I hate to sail on this rotten tub.
""Leave her, Johnny, leave her!""
No grog allowed and rotten grub.
And it's time for us to leave her.
Leave her, Johnny, leave her!
Oh, leave her, Johnny, leave her!
For the voyage is long and the winds don't blow
And it's time for us to leave her.
We swear by rote for want of more.
""Leave her, Johnny, leave her!""
But now were through so we'll go on shore.
And it's time for us to leave her.
Leave her, Johnny, leave her!
Oh, leave her, Johnny, leave her!
For the voyage is long and the winds don't blow
And it's time for us to leave her."
