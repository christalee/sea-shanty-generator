2, A Life On The Ocean Wave ,"A life on the ocean wave

          A-home on the rolling deep  

          Where the scattered waters rave  

          And the winds their revels keep  

          Like an eagle caged I pine  

          On this dull, unchanging shore  

        Oh give me the flashing brine  The spray and the tempest's roar CHORUS after each verse         A life on the ocean wave, a-home on the rolling deep Where the scattered waters rave and the winds their revels keep       The winds - the winds - the winds their revels  - keep       The winds - the winds - the winds their revels  - keep
        

Once more on the deck I stand  Of my own swift, gliding craft  Set sail, farewell to land  The gale follows fair abaft.  We shoot through the sparkling foam,  Like an ocean bird set free  Like the ocean bird, our home We'll find far out on the sea
        


        The land is no longer in view,  The clouds have begun to frown.  But with a stout vessel and crew  We'll say  Let the storm come down  And the song of our heart shall be  While the winds and waters lave  A life on the heaving sea A-home on the bounding wave"

8,Abdul Abulbul Amir  ,"Percy French 1877courtesy of www.SailorSongs.comThe sons of the Prophet are brave men and bold

        And quite unaccustomed to fear,

        But the bravest by far in the ranks of the shah,

        Was Abdul Abulbul Amir.

If you wanted a man to encourage the van,

        Or harass the foe from the rear,
Storm fort or redoubt, you had only to shout
for Abdul Abulbul Amir.

Now the heroes were plenty and well known to fame

        Iin the troops that were led by the Czar,
And the bravest of these was a man by the name
of Ivan Skavinsky Skavar.

        One day this bold Russian, he shouldered his gun
And donned his most truculent sneer,
Downtown he did go where he trod on the toe
Of Abdul Abulbul Amir.

""Young man,"" quote Abdul,"" has life grown so dull
That you wish to end your career?
Vile infidel know, you have trod on the toe
Of Abdul Abulbul Amir.

So take your last look at the sunshine and brook
And send your regrets to the Czar
For by this I imply, you are going to die,
Count Ivan Skavinsky Skavar.""

Then this bold Mameluke drew his trusty skibouk,
Singing, ""Allah! Il Allah! Al-lah!""
And with murderous intent he ferociously went
for Ivan Skavinsky Skavar.

They parried and thrust, they side-stepped and cussed,
Of blood they spilled a great part;
The philologist blokes, who seldom crack jokes,
Say that hash was first made on the spot.

They fought all that night neath the pale yellow moon;
The din, it was heard from afar,
And huge multitudes came, so great was the fame,
of Abdul and Ivan Skavar.

As Abdul's long knife was extracting the life,
In fact he was shouting, ""Huzzah!""
He felt himself struck by that wily Calmuck,
Count Ivan Skavinsky Skavar.

The Sultan drove by in his red-breasted fly,
Expecting the victor to cheer,
But he only drew nigh to hear the last sigh,
Of Abdul Abulbul Amir.

There's a tomb rises up where the Blue Danube rolls,
And graved there in characters clear,
Is, ""Stranger, when passing, oh pray for the soul
Of Abdul Abulbul Amir.""

A splash in the Black Sea one dark moonless night
Caused ripples to spread wide and far,
It was made by a sack fitting close to the back,
of Ivan Skavinsky Skavar.

A Muscovite maiden her lone vigil keeps,
'Neath the light of the cold northern star,
And the name that she murmurs in vain as she weeps,
Is Ivan Skavinsky Skavar.            "

        Hee was no sooner ouer the riuer,
        Downe in a fforrest to take the ayre,
        But Eighty merchants of London cittye 
        Came kneeling before King Henery there.

        ""O yee are welcome, rich merchants, 
        Good saylers, welcome unto me!""
        They swore by the rood they were saylers good, 
        But rich merchants they cold not  bee.

        Nor Burdeaux voyage wee dare  not ffare,
        And all ffor a ffalse robber that lyes on the seas,
        And robbs us of our  merchants ware.""

        And swore by the Lord that was  mickle of might,
        ""I thought he had not beene in the world throughout 
        That durst haue wrought  England such unright.""

        Will ffeitch yond traitor unto mee?""

        ""Yes, that dare I!"" sayes my lord Charles Haward, 
        Neere to the king  wheras hee did stand;
        ""If that Your Grace will give me leave, 
        My selfe will be the only  man.""

        ""Thou shult have six hundred men"" saith our king, 
        ""And chuse them  out of my realme soe ffree;
        Besids marriners and boyes 
        To guide the great shipp on the sea ""

        ""Ile goe speake with Sir Andrew,"" 
        sais Charles,  my lord Haward;
        ""Upon the sea, if he be there 
        I will bring him and his shipp to shore

        Or before my prince I will never come neer.""The ffirst of all my lord did  call 
        A noble gunner hee was one; 
        This man was three score yeeres and ten,
        Anr Peeter Simon was his name.

        ""Peeter,"" sais hee, ""I must sayle the sea, 
        To seeke out an enemye;  God be my speed
        Before all others I have chosen thee; 
        Of a hundred gunners thoust be my  head.""

        ""My lord,"" sais hee, ""if you have chosen mee 
        Of a hundred gunners  to be the head,
        Hange me att your maine-mast tree 
        If I misse my marke past three pence  bread.""

        The next of all my lord he did call, 
        A noble bowman hee was one;
        In Yorekeshire was this gentleman borne, 
        And William Horsley was his name.

        ""Horsley,"" sayes hee, ""I must sayle to the sea, 
        To seeke out an  enemye; God be my speede
        Before all others I have chosen thee; 
        Of a hundred bowemen thoust be my  head.""

        ""My lord,"" sais he, ""if you haue chosen mee  
        Of a hundred  bowemen to be the head,
        Hang me att your mainemast-tree
        If I misse my marke past twelve pence  bread.""

        With pikes, and gunnes, and bowemen bold 
        this noble Haward is gone to the sea,
        On the day before midsummer-even, 
        And out att Thames mouth sayled they.

        They had not sayled dayes three
        Upon their journey they tooke in hand,
        But there they mett with a noble shipp, And
        stoutely made itt both stay and  stand.

        ""Thou must tell me thy name,"" sais 
        Charles,  my lord Haward,
        ""Or who thou art, or ffrom whence thou came, 
        Yea, and where thy dwelling  is,
        To whom and where thy shipp does belong.""

        ""My name,"" says hee, ""is Henery Hunt, 
        With a pure hart and a  penitent mind;
        I and my shipp they doe belong 
        Unto the New-castle that stands vpon Tine""'

        ""Now thou must tell me, Harry Hunt, 
        As thou hast sayled by day and by  night,
        Hast thou not heard of a stout robber? 
        Men calls him Sir Andrew Bartton, Knight.

        But ever he sighed, and sayd, ""Alas! 
        Ffull well, my lord, I know that wight;
        He robd me of my merchants ware,
        And I was his prisoner but yesternight.""

        ""As I was sayling upon the sea, 
        And a Burdeaux voyage as I did ffare,
        He clasped me to his archborde, 
        And robd me of all my merchantsware.""

        ""And I am a man both poore and bare, 
        And every man will have his owne of  me,
        And I am bound towards London to ffare, 
        To complaine to my prince Henerye.""

        ""That shall not need,"" sais my lord Haward; 
        ""If thou canst lett  me this robber see,
        Ffor euery peny he hath taken thee ffroe, 
        Thou shalt be rewarded a  shilling."" quoth hee.

        ""Now God fforefend"" sais Henery Hunt 
        ""My lord, you shold worke  soe ffarr amisse!
        God keepe you out of that traitors hands!
        For you wott ffull litle what a man  hee is.

        ""Hee is brasse within, and steele without, 
        And beames hee beares in his  topcastle stronge;
        His shipp hath ordinance cleane round about; 
        Besids, my lord, hee is verry well  mand.

        ""He hath a pinnace, is deerlye dight, 
        Saint Andrews crosse, that is his  guide;
        His pinnace beares nine score men and more, 
        Besids fifteen cannons on euery  side.

        ""If you wvere twenty shippes, and he but one, 
        Either in archboard or in  hall,
        He would overcome you everye one, 
        And if his beames they doe downe ffall""

        ""This is cold comfort"" sais my Lord Haward, 
        ""To wellcome a  stranger thus to the sea;
        I'll bring him and his shipp to shore, 
        Or else into Scottland hee shall carrye  mee""

        ""Then you must gett a noble gunner, my lord, 
        That can sett well with his  eye,
        And sinke his pinnace into the sea, 
        And soone then overcome will hee bee.

        ""And when that you haue done this,
        If you chance Sir Andrew for to bord,
        Lett no man to his topcastle goe;
        And I will giue you a glasse, my lord.""

        ""And then you need to ffeare no Scott, 
        Whether you sayle by day or by  night;
        And to-morrow, by seven of the clocke, 
        You shall meete with Sir Andrew Barton,  Knight.

        ""I was his prisoner but yesternight, 
        And he hath taken mee sworne,""  quoth hee;
        ""I trust my Lord God will me fforgive 
        And if that oath then broken  bee.""

        ""You must lend me sixe peeces, my lord;"" quoth hee 
        ""Into my shipp,  to sayle the sea,
        And tomorrow, by nine of the clocke, 
        Your Honour againe then will I see.""

        And the hache-bord where Sir Andrew lay
        Is hached with gold deerlye dight:
        ""Now by my ffaith;"" sais Charles, my lord Haward 
        ""Then yonder  Scott is a worthye wight!""

        ""Take in your ancyents and your standards, 
        Yea that no man shall them see,
        And put me fforth a white willow wand, 
        As merchants use to sayle the sea.""

        But they stirred neither top nor mast, 
        But Sir Andrew they passed by:
        ""whatt English are yonder,"" said Sir Andrew
        ""That can so litle  curtesye?""

        ""I have beene admirall over the sea
        More then these yeeres three;
        There is never an English dog, nor Portingall 
        Can passe this way without leave  of me.""

        ""But now yonder pedlers, they are past 
        Which is no litle greffe to me;
        Ffeich them backe;"" sayes Sir Andrew Barton 
        ""They shall all hang att  my maine-mast tree.

        With that the pinnace itt shott of 
        That my Lord Haward might it well ken
        Itt stroke downe my lords fforemast 
        And killed fourteen of my lord his men.

        ""Come hither, Simon!"" sayes my lord Haward
        ""Looke that thy words  be true thou sayed;
        I'll hang thee att my main-mast tree
        If thou misse thy marke past twelve pence  bread.

        Simon was old, but his hart itt was bold; 
        Hee tooke downe a peece, and layd itt  ffull lowe
        He put in chaine yeards nine,
        Besids other great shott lesse and more.

        With that hee lett his gun-shott goe; 
        Soe well hee settled itt with his eye,
        The ffirst sight that Sir Andrew sawe 
        Hee see his pinnace sunke in the sea.

        When hee saw his pinnace sunke,
        Lord! in his hart hee was not well:
        ""Cutt my ropes! itt is time to be gon!
        I'le goe ffeitch yond pedlers backe  my selfe!""

        When my lord Haward saw Sir Andrew loose,
        Lord! in his hart that hee was ffaine:
        ""Strike on your drummes! spread out your ancyents 
        Sound out your trumpetts!  sound out amaine!""

        ""Ffight on, my men!"" sais Sir Andrew Bartton; 
        Weate, howsoever this  geere will sway,
        Itt is my lord Admirall of England 
        Is come to seeke mee on the sea.""

        Simon had a sonne; with shott of a gunn-
        Well Sir Andrew might itt ken-
        He shott itt in att a priuye place, 
        And killed sixty more of Sir Andrews men.

        Harry Hunt came in att the other syde, 
        And att Sir Andrew hee shott then;
        He drove downe his fformast-tree,
        And killed eighty more of Sir Andrews men.

        ""I have done a good turne,"" sayes Harry Hunt;
        ""Sir Andrew is not  our kings ffriend;
        He hoped to haue undone me yesternight, 
        But I hope I have quitt him well in the  end.""

        ""Ever alas!"" sayd Sir Andrew Barton 
        ""what shold a man either  thinke or say?
        Yonder ffalse theeffe is my strongest enemye 
        Who was my prisoner but yesterday.

        ""Come hither to me, thou Gourden good, 
        And be thou readye att my call,
        And I will give thee three hundred pound 
        If thou wilt lett my beames down ffall""

        With that hee swarved the maine-mast tree, 
        Soe did he itt with might and maine;
        Horseley, with a bearing arrow, 
        Stroke the Gourden through the braine.

        And he ffell into the haches againe,
        And sore of this wound that he did bleed;
        There word went through Sir Andrews men, 
        That the Gourden hee was dead.

        ""Comie hither to me, James Hambliton, 
        Thou are my sisters sonne, I have no  more;
        I will give thee six hundred pound
        If thou will lett my beames downe ffall.""

        With that hee swarved the maine-mast tree, 
        Soe did hee itt with might and maine:
        Horseley, with another broad arrow,
        Strike the yeaman through the braine.

        That hee ffell downe to the haches againe; 
        Sore of his wound that hee did bleed;
        Covetousness getts no gaine, 
        Itt is verry true, as the Welchman sayd.

        But when hee saw his sisters sonne slaine,
        Lord! in his heart hee was not well:
        ""Goe ffeitch me downe my armour of prooffe, 
        For I will to the topcastle my-selfe.

        ""Goe ffeitch me downe my armour of prooffe,
        For it is guilded with gold soe  cleare;
        God be with my brother, John of Bartton!
        Amongst the Portingalls hee did itt  weare.""

        But when hee had his armour of prooffe, 
        And on his body hee had itt on,
        Every man that looked att him Sayd, 
        ""Gunn nor arrow he neade feare  none""

        ""Come hither, Horsley!"" sayes my lord Haward,
        ""And looke your  shaft that itt goe right;
        Shoot a good shoote in the time of need, 
        And ffor thy shooting thoust be made a  knight!""

        ""I'le doe my best,"" sayes Horsley then, 
        ""Your Honor shall see  beffore I goe;
        If I shold be hanged att your mainemast,
        I have in my shipp but arrowes  tow.""

        But att Sir Andrew hee shott then;
        Hee mede sure to hitt his marke;
        Vnder the spole of his right arme 
        Hee smote Sir Andrew quite through the hart.

        Yett ffrom the tree hee wold not start, 
        But hee clinged to itt with might and  maine;
        Vnder the coller then of his jacke, 
        He stroke Sir Andrew thorrow the braine.

        ""Ffight on my men,"" sayes Sir Andrew Barton,
        ""I arm hurt, but I  am not slaine;
        I'le lay mee downe and bleed a-while, 
        And then I'le rise and ffight againe.

        ""Ffight on my men,"" sayes Sir Andrew Bartton 
        ""These English doggs  they bite soe lowe;
        Ffight on ffor Scottland and Saint Andew 
        Till you heare my whistle blowe!""

        But when they cold not heare his whistle blow, 
        Sayes Harry Hunt, ""I'le lay  my head
        You may bord yonder noble shipp, my lord, 
        For I know Sir Andrew hee is  dead.""

        With that they borded this noble shipp, 
        Soe did they itt with might and maine;
        The ffound eighteen score Scotts alive, 
        Besids the rest were maimed and slaine.

        My Lord Haward tooke a sword in his hand, 
        And smote off Sir Andrews head;
        The Scotts stood by did weepe and mourne,
        But never a word durst speake or say.

        He caused his body to be taken downe, 
        And ouer the hatch-bord cast into the sea,
        And about his middle three hundred crownes:
        ""whersoever thou lands, it will  bury thee.""

        With his head they sayled into England againe, 
        With right good will, and fforce  and main,
        And the day beffore Newyeeres even Into 
        Thames mouth they came againe.

        My lord Haward wrote to King Heneryes grace, 
        With all the newes hee cold him  bring:
        ""Such a Newyeeres gifft I have brought to your Grace 
        As neuer did subject  to any king.

        ""Ffor merchandyes and manhood, 
        The like is nott to be ffound; 
        The sight of these wold doe you good, 
        Ffor you haue not the like in your English  ground."" But when hee heard tell that they  were come,
        Full royally hee welcomed them home;
        Sir Andrew's shipp was the kings Newyeeres guifft; 
        A braver shipp you never saw  none.

        Now hath our king Sir Andrews shipp, 
        Besett with pearles and precyous stones;
        Now hath England two shipps of warr, 
        Two shipps of warr, before but one.

        ""who holpe to this?"" sayes King Henerye, 
        ""That I may reward him  ffor his paine:""
        ""Harry Hunt, and Peeter Simon, William Horseleay, and 
        I the same.""

        ""Harry Hunt shall haue his whistle and chain 
        And all his jewells,  whatsoever they be
        And other rich giffts that I will not name
        For his good service he hath  done.""

        ""Horslay, right thoust be a knight, 
        Lands and livings thou shalt have store
        Haward shall be erle of Nottingham 
        And soe was never Haward before.

        ""Now, Peeter Simon, thou art old;
        I will maintaine thee and thy sonne;
        Thou shalt have five hundred pound all in gold
        For the good service that  thou hast done.""

        Then King Henerye shiffted his roome 
        In came the Queene and ladyes bright;
        Other arrands they had none 
        But to see Sir Andrew Bartton, Knight.

        But when they see his deadly fface, 
        His eyes were hollow in his head;
        ""I wold give a hundred pound,"" sais King Henry
        ""The man were  alive as hee is dead!

        ""Yett for the manfull part that hee hath playd 
        Both heere and beyond the  sea,
        His men shall have halfe a crowne a day 
        To bring them to my brother, King Jamye!""   "

17, Asleep In The Deep ,"Stormy the night and the waves roll high,
        
Bravely the ship doth ride, 
Hark! while the lighthouse bell's solemn cry 
Rings over the sullen tide

        There on the deck see two lovers stand,
        
        Heart to heart beating, and hand to hand;
        Though death be near, she knows no fear
        
        While at her side is one of all most dearCHORUS
        Loudly the bell in the old  tower rings,
        
        Bidding us list to the warning  it brings  
        sailor, take care -  sailor, take care

        Danger is near thee, beware, beware,   beware, beware
        
        Many brave hearts are asleep in  the deep,  
        so beware, beware 
          Many brave hearts are asleep in  the deep,
 so beware, beware 
What of the storm when the night is over
        
        There is no trace or sign.
        Save where the wreckage hath strewn the shore
        
        Peaceful the sun doth shine.

        But when the wild raging storm did cease,
        
        Under the billows two hearts found peace
        No more to part  no more of pain
        
        The bell may now tell its warning in vain. "

        To shun the gates of hell,  
        But against them I rebelled,  
      When I sailed. 3  I'd a Bible in my hand,  
      When I sailed, when I sailed,  
      I'd a Bible in my hand,  When I sailed,  
      I'd a Bible in my hand,  
      By my father's great command,  
      And I sunk it in the sand,  When I sailed. 4  I murdered William Moore,  
      As I sailed, as I sailed  
      I murdered William Moore,  As I sailed,  
      I murdered William Moore,  
      And laid him in his gore,  
      Not many leagues from shore,  As I sailed. 5  I was sick and nigh to death,  
      As I sailed, as I sailed  
      I was sick and nigh to death,  
      As I sailed,  
      I was sick and nigh to death,  
      And I vowed with every breath,  
      To walk in wisdom's ways,  When I sailed. 6  I thought I was undone,  
      As I sailed, as I sailed  
      I thought I was undone,  As I sailed,  
      I thought I was undone,  
      And my wicked glass had run,  
      But health did soon return,  As I sailed. 7  My repentance lasted not,  
      As I sailed, as I sailed  
      My repentance lasted not,  As I sailed,  
      My repentance lasted not,  
      My vows I soon forgot,  
      Damnation was my lot,  As I sailed. 8  I spied three ships from France,  
      As I sailed, as I sailed  
      I spied three ships from France,  As I sailed,  
      I spied three ships from France,  
      To them I did advance,
And took them all by chance,  As I sailed. 9  I spied three ships from Spain,  As I sailed, as I sailed  
      I spied three ships from Spain,  As I sailed,  
      I spied three ships from Spain,  
      I looted them for gain,  
      Till most of them were slain,  As I sailed. 10  I'd ninety bars of gold,  
      As I sailed, as I sailed  
      I'd ninety bars of gold,  As I sailed,  
      I'd ninety bars of gold,  
      And dollars manifold,  
      With riches uncontrolled,  As I sailed. 11  Thus being o'ertaken at last,  
      As I sailed, as I sailed  
      Thus being o'ertaken at last,  As I sailed,  
      Thus being o'ertaken at last,  
      And into prison cast,  
      And sentence being passed,  As I sailed. 12  Farewell, the raging main,  
      I must die, I must die,  
      Farewell, the raging main,  
      I must die,  Farewell, the raging main,  
      To Turkey, France, and Spain,  
      I shall never see you again,  For I must die. 13  To the Execution Dock,  
      I must go, I must go,  
      To the Execution Dock,  I must go,  
      To the Execution Dock,  
      While many thousands flock,  
      But I must bear the shock,  
      And must die. 14  Come all ye young and old,  
      And see me die, see me die,  
      Come all ye young and old,  And see me die,  
      Come all ye young and old,  
      You're welcome to my gold,  
      For by it I've lost my soul,  And must die. 15  Take a warning now by me,  
      For I must die, I must die,  
      Take a warning now by me,  For I must die,  
      Take a warning now by me,  
      And shun bad company,  
      Let you come to hell with me,  For I must die."
21,The Balena,"On the noble fleet of whalers out sailing from Dundee  
      Well manned by British sailors to work them on the sea 
      On the western ocean passage none with them can compare 
      For there's not a ship could make the trip as the ""Balena"" I declare
        
 CHORUS:

          And the wind is on her quarter and her engine working free

 And there's not another whaler a-sailing from Dundee          

Can beat the old ""Balena"" and you need not try her on          

          For we challenge all both large and small from Dundee to St. Johns There's the new built ""Terra Nova"", she's a model with no doubt  
      There's the ""Arctic"" and ""Aurora"", you've heard so much about  
      There's Jacklin's model mail-boat, the terror of the sea 
      Couldn't beat the old ""Balena"" boys, on a passage from Dundee...CHORUS And it happened on the Thursday four days after we left Dundee
Was carried off the quarter boats all in a raging sea 
That took away our bulwark, our stanchions and our rails 
And left the whole concern boys, a-floating in the gales...CHORUS Bold Jacklin carries canvas and fairly raises steam  
      And Captain Guy's a daring boy, goes ploughing through the stream 
      But Millan says the ""Eskimo"" could beat the blooming lot  
      But to beat the old ""Balena"" boys, they'd find it rather hot...CHORUS An' now that we've landed boys, where the rum is mighty cheap  
      We'll drink success to the Captain, for getting us over the deep 
      And a health to all our sweet hearts, an' to our wives so fair 
      Not another ship could make that trip but the ""Balena"" I declare..."

        recorded by Oscar Brand on Bawdy Sea Songs"
25,Banks Of The Brandywine  ,"One morning very early, 
      
      In the pleasant month of May 
      As I walked out to take the air, 
      All nature being gay; 
      The moon had not yet veiled her face, 
      But through the trees did shine 
      As I wandered forth to take the air 
      On the banks of Brandywine.

      2
      At such an early hour I was surprised to see 
      
      A lovely maid with downcast eyes |
      Upon those banks so gay
      I modestly saluted her, 
      She knew not my design 
      
      And requested her sweet company 
      On the banks of Brandywine

      3
      I pray, young man, be civil, 
      My company forsake 
      For in my real opinion     I think you are a rake, 
      My love's a valiant sailor, 
      He's now gone to the Main 
      While comfortless I wander 
      On he banks of Brandywine

      4
      My dear, why do you thus 
      Give up to melancholy cries
      I pray give up your weeping, 
      And dry those lovely eyes, 
      For sailors in each port, my dear, 
      They do a mistress find 
      He will leave you to wander 
      On the banks of Brandywine

      5
      O leave me, sir, do leave me     Why do you me torment? 
      My Henry's wont to see me, 
      Therefore I am content.
      Why do you thus torment me, 
      And cruelly combine 
      To fill my heart with horror 
      On the banks of Brandywine

      6
      I wish not to afflict your mind, 
      But rather for to ease 
      Such dreadful apprehensions, 
      They soon your heart will seize. 
      Your love, my dear, in wedlock bands, 
      Another one has joined.
      She swooned into my arms 
      On the banks of Brandywine.

      7
      The lofty hills and craggy rocks 
      Re-echoed back her strains
      The pleasant groves and rural shades 
      Were witness to her pains. 
      How often has he promised me 
      In Hymen's chains to join 
      Now I'm a maid forsaken 
      On the banks of Brandywine

      8
      O no, my dear, that ne'er shall be     Behold your Henry now 
      I clasp you to my bosom, love     I've not forgot our vow 
      It's now I know you're true, my dear     In Hymen's chains we'll join 
      And bless the happy morn we met     On the banks of Brandywine"

        When you sail on them packet ships, 
        No dungaree jumpers wear

        All ready to your hand

        Off the banks of Newfoundland 
CHORUS: 

        We'll scrape her and we'll scrub her

With holy stone and sand 

        For there blows some cold nor'westers

        On the banks of Newfoundland We had Jack Lynch  from Malnahinch, 
        Mike Murphy and some more 
        I tell you well, they suffered like hell 
        On the way to  Baltimore 
        They pawned there gear in Liverpool 
        And sailed as they  did stand 
        For there blow some cold nor'westers 
        On the banks of  Newfoundland...CHORUS Now the mate he stood on the fo'c'sle head 
        And  loudly he did roar 
        Come rattle her in me lucky lads, 
        You're bound for America's shore 
        Come wipe the blood off that dead man's face 
        And haul or you'll be damned 
        For there blow some cold nor'westers
On the banks of Newfoundland...CHORUSSo now we're off the  hook me boys, 
        And the land is white with snow 
        And soon we'll see the pay table 
        And we'll spend the  whole night below 
        And on the docks, come down in flocks, 
        Those pretty  girls will say 
        Ah, It's snugger with me than on the sea, 
        On the banks  of Newfoundland...CHORUS"
27,Banks of The Nile ," Farewell, my dearest Nancy, Farewell I must away. 
        I hear the drums a-beating and no longer I can stay. 

        For we're orders out of Portsmouth Town and for many a long mile
        For to fight the blacks and heathens on the banks of the Nile.      Oh,
          I'll cut off my curly locks and along with you I'll go
I'll dress myself in velveteen and go and see Egypt, too.

I'll fight and bear thy banners well, kind fortune upon thee smile.
And we'll comfort one another on the banks of the Nile. 
          Oh, your waist it is too slender love and your waist it is too small. 
        I'm afraid that you won't answer me if l should on you call 

        Your delicate constitution will not stand the unwholesome soil. 
        Nor the dark, nor the sandy climate on the banks of the Nile. 
          O Willie, dearest William don't leave me here to mourn, 
        You'll make me curse and rue the day for whenever I'd been born. 

        For the parting of my own true love and the parting of me life
Now stay at home, dear William and I will be thee wife. 
          My curse upon the war and the hour that it began 
        For it has robbed our count -e-ry of many a gallant man 

        It took from us our old sweethearts protectors of our soil 
        And their blood does steep the grass that's deep on the banks of the Nile. 
          Let a hundred days be darkened and let maidens give a sigh
It would melt the very elements to hear the wounded cry 

Let a hundred days be brightened and let the maidens give a smile 
But remember Abercrombie on the banks of the Nile. 
          O now the war is over and back I'll then return 
        Unto my wife and family I'll leave behind to mourn. 

        We'll call them in around me boys and there's no end of toil. 
        And no more we'll go a roving on the banks of the Nile. "

29,The Banks of Sweet Loch Ray,"I am as poor a distressed maid as ever yet was known. 
        By love I'm captivated which is proved my overthrow.
When herding out my father's flocks
By accidence did stray it was there 
I met my sailor bold On the banks of sweet Loch Ray. Good morning to you, fair maid, he said, with a heart so free  ""
        And would you be contented to go along with me 
        I will dress you like Queen Helen all in your Grecian style 
        And when we'll go to the town of Boyle I will there make you my bride."" 
        With a modest blush this fair maid said, your suit I must deny 
        For I am no way fitting to be a sailor's bride. 
        Far from my native country I am not inclined to stray 
        For my heart would break were I to leave  The banks of sweet Loch Ray."" Fair maiden, I will not ask you to leave your native place. 
        We will here set down and court awhile all in this silent place, 
        We will set down and court awhile among the flowers so gay 
        And herd your sheep as they do feed  On the banks of sweet Loch Ray Rolled up in the rapture of the night the time stole slowly on. 
        My love has taken flight and from me he has gone.
I'll never love a young man I never loved any young man half so well 
And where to find my sailor bold  I'm sure I cannot tell. 

My sailor bold he's gone from me and he's crossed o'er the Main. 
I mean for to live single until he returns again.
A crown of gold I would bestow and at his feet I'd lay. 
I 'd bid adieu forevermore   To the banks of sweet Loch Ray "

        And he's the smallest manCHORUS:    6- We have the noble waist boat      
        Whose crew are very good      
        Their boatheader is a Dartmouth man      
        His name is Mister Wood.      
        And when they lower in their boat      
        They don't make any noise      
        But when you talk of pulling      
        They are the very boysCHORUS    7- We have another boat now      
        It's called the bow boat.      
        She's one of the jolliest crafts      
        That ever yet did float      
        Hiller pulls the bow oar      
        And Blankenship the stroke      
        Dexter pulls harpooner      
        And Jenny heads the boat  - CHORUS"

        For seven long years        I’ve been constantly waiting

        Since he crossed the Bay of Biscay-oh
      
        One night as Mary lay sleeping          

        A knock came to her bedroom door

        Saying Arise arise, my dearest Mary        

        For to earn one glimpse of your Willy-oh
        Young Mary rose, put on her clothing           

        And to the bedroom door did go

        And there she spied her Willy standing           

        His two pale cheeks as white as snow
        Oh Willy dear where are those blushes  

        Those blushes I knew long years ago

        Oh Mary dear - the cold clay ashed them          

        I am only the ghost of your Willy -oh
        Oh Mary dear, the dawn is breaking          

        Don’t you think it’s time for me to go

        I am leaving you quite broken hearted

For to cross the Bay of Biscay-oh
        If I had all the gold and silver          

        And all the money in Mexico

        I would grant it all to the king of Erin

It's boundless mercy sent,

        Let him climb the rigging like his daddy used to do. 

        Once there was a waitress in the Prince George Hotel 
        Her mistress was a lady and her master was a swell. They knew she was a simple girl and lately from the farm. 
        And so they watched her carefully to keep her from all harm. The Forty Second Fusiliers came marching into town 
        And with them came a complement of rapists of renown. They busted every maidenhead that came within their spell. 
        But they never made the waitress from the Prince George Hotel. Next came a company  of the Prince of Wales' Hussars 
        They piled into the whore house and they packed along the bars. Many a maid and mistress and wife before them fell. 
        But they never made the waitress from the Prince George Hotel. One day there came a sailor just an ordinary bloke 
        A-bulging at the trousers with a heart of solid oak. At sea without a woman for seven years or more. 
        There wasn't any need to ask what he was looking for. He asked her for a candlestick to light his way to bed 
        He asked her for a pillow to rest his weary head. And speaking to her gently just as if he meant no harm 
        He asked her if she'd come to bed just so's to keep him warm. She lifted up the blanket and a moment there did lie 
        He was on her; he was in her in the twinkling of an eye He was out again, and in again, and plowing up a storm. 
        And the only words she said to him ""I hope you're keeping warm."" When early in the morning the sailor he arose 
        Saying here's a two pound note my dear, for the damage I have done. If you have a daughter, bounce her on your knee. 
        If you have a son, send the bastard out to sea."

37,The Bigler," On the Sunday morning, just at the hour of ten 
         When the tug Mico Robert towed the schooner Bigler through Lake Michigan  
        O, there we made our canvas in the middle of the fleet 
        And the wind hauled to the south'ard boys so we had to give her sheet CHORUS - sung after every verse:               Watch her catch her jump in her ju-baju       - 
        Give her sheet and let her go       
        The lads will pull her through - And don't you hear her howling 
        When the wind was blowing free - On our down trip to Buffalo from Milwaukee    
The wind comes down from the south southeast it blows both stiff and strong  
        You'd ought to've seen that little schooner Bigler as she pulled out
Lake Michigan  Oh far beyond her foaming bows the fiery lights aflame 
With every stitch of canvas and her course was wing and wing Passing by the Proctors the wind was blowing free  
        Sailing by the Beavers with the Skillaglee on our lea 
        Oh we hauled her in full and bye as close as she would lie  
        And we weathered Waugoshance to enter the Straits of Mackinaw        At Huron we made Presque Isle Light and then we tore away,  
        The wind it being fair, for the Isle of Thunder Bay. 
        Then the wind it shifted and the night it came on dark, 
        The captain kept a sharp lookout for the light at Point aux Barques. We passed the light and kept in sight of Michigan north shore,  
        A-boomin' for the river as we'd often done before, 
        When just abreast of Port Huron Light, both anchors we let go, 
        And the Sweepstake came 'longside and took the Bigler in tow She took the seven of us in tow, all of us fore and aft,  
        She towed us down to Lake St. Clare and stuck us on the flat. 
        Then eased the Hunter's tow line to give us all relief, 
        The Bigler fell astern and went into a boat called the Maple Leaf. And then the Sweepstake towed us out beyond the river light,  
        Lake Erie for to roam and the blustering winds to fight, 
        The wind being from the south'ard, it blew a pretty gale, 
        And we took it as it came for we could not carry sail. We made the Eau and passed Long Point, the wind now blowing free,
        We bowled along the Canada shore, Port Colborne on our lee, 
        What is that that looms ahead? We knew as we drew near,
That blazing like a star, shone the light on Buffalo Pier. And now we're safely moored in the Buffalo Creek at last,
And under Brigg's elevator the Bigler is made fast. 
And in some lager beer saloon we'll let the bottle pass, 
For we're all happy shipmates and we like a social glass"

        Though once I was carefree,  And a brave sailor lad

        I courted a lassie,  By night, and by day  

        But now, she has left me,  And sailed far away. CHORUS - sung after every verse
                    
        Oh if I was a blackbird, and could whistle and sing

        I'd follow the vessel, my true love sails in 

        And in that top riggin', I would there build my nest                    And I'd flutter my wings O'er her lily white breast.
    
        Or if I was a scholar,  And could handle the pen
  
        One secret love-letter,  To my true love I'd send  

        And tell of my sorrow,  My grief and my pain
  
        Since she's gone and left me,  In yon floating land
      
        I've sailed on the ocean,  My fortune to seek            Oh, I miss her caress,  And her kiss on my cheek          I returned and I told her,  My love was still warm  

        But she turned away lightly,  And great was her scorn
    
        I offered to take her,  To Donneybrooke fair  

        And to buy her fine ribbons,  To tie up her hair  

        I offered to marry,  And stay by her side  

        But she says in the morning,  She sails with the tide      

        My parents, they chide me,  They will not agree  

        Saying that me and my false-love,  Married shouldn't never be

40,Bold Dighton,"Come all you bold heroes that plough the rough main,  
          Give ear to our story, the truth I'll explain.  
        It was our misfortune which happened in great war,  
        And how we escaped from the French at Bastar.        We were then confined on the Guadaloupe shore,      
        Of true valiant seamen four hundred or more,
        Shut up in a small compass being greatly distressed,      
        With painful disease and famine oppressed.            A gallant young hero, from Saint Lucia he came,          
        Both generous and wealthy, called Dighton by name.          
        He had the heart of a lion, the soul of a prince,          
        And friends's kind impulse to us did evince. He came to our prison, he mourned our sad fate,  
        He launched out his gold to relieve our sad state.  
        Five hundred bright guineas he gave, I am sure,  
        Which did greatly relieve us in this distressed hour. At this generous action the French did complain.      
        They soon did confine him with fetters and chains      
        With us in the prison, it was them we might see,      
        But from his chains and fetters we soon set him free.            Says Dighton, ""My boys, if you'll take my advice, 
        Now if you'll prove constant it is done in a trice.          
        For 'tis down by yon pier the Tyger does lay,
        A stout and fine coaster, she is fit for the sea. The captain's on shore and we have all things on board,  
        A plenty of cannons, pikes, pistols, and swords.  
        Now if you will prove constant and stand by my side,  
        We will board her, my boys, and we will sail the next tide.        

        Then at this adventure we all did agree,      
        Each breast loaded with ardor to fight and be free. 
        Come give us your signal,"" each sailor replied, 
        We are ready to conquer, or die by your side.                Prepare for the conflict, no longer delay.          
  But keep yourselves cool, boys, my orders obey.""          
  Three gallant young seamen as seconds he chose.          
  Our signal for freedom was, ""Death to our foes!"" Then out of prison we all rushed amain.  
        The three guns were fired, the French guards were slain.  
        On board of the Tiger we soon rushed our way.  
        We cut both her cables and stood out to sea.        Which caused a sad rumpus, it being midnight.      
          The Frenchmen bawled out in a terrible fright,          ""Mon Dieu, fracter engie!""
          Drums beat and bells toll,      Our hero shouts, ""Freedom!"" to each valiant soul. Their fortress was open, their cannon did play,          
        Their shot flew iike hail as we got under way.          
        They shattered our spars as we sailed from the shore.          
        To bid them good-bye we a broadside let pour. 

        Then out of all danger we thought ourselves clear,  
        But for this mistake we did pay very dear.  
        Next morning at dayiight it was there we espied  
        The Lion, a corvette, hang down on our side. 
She plied us with grapeshot with broadside so sore,      
        Which caused the Tiger to make her guns roar.      
        With thirty-six eighteens the Lion did growl,      
        And eighteen brass nines the fierce Tiger did bowl.            Yard-arms and broadsides, for three glasses we lay,
        At length our broadside cut her mainmast away.          
        Says Dighton, ""My boys, if you are tired of this fun 
        You now have your choice, to fight or to run!""To spare blood and slaughter the crew did incline.  
        To run down the corvette it was our design.  
        But at this same moment she grappled us fierce,  
        And then sword in hand was our only resource.        To board and to slaughter they were fully bent.      
        To give us no quarters was their sole intent.      
        To board us thrice over they tried with this view,      
        But they were repulsed by the Tiger's bold crew.            Then Dighton cried out as each hero should feel,          
        Whose eyes transferred fury like bright burnished steel,          
        ""There is death to each man on the point of my sword. 
  Come all my bold heroes, let us jump overboard!"" 

  Then over the bulwark he jumped like a roe.  
        One stroke from his sabre laid two Frenchmen low.  
        On board of the corvette we all rushed so fierce  
        That soon from their quarters the French did disperse.        Steel sparkle, pikes rattle, and swords loudly clash,      
          And the blood on her decks like salt water did dash.      
          Her scuppers with huge streams of crimson did pour,      
        And the blue seas all round us rolled purple with gore.              Three hundred brave seamen were slain of their crew,          
  When the Frenchmen gave out and they cried, ""Mon Dieu!""          
          They fell on their knees and their weapons let fall,          
        And then our bold hero for quarter did call. We soon gave them quarter and then we did hear  
          That for to engage us they did volunteer.  
          They trebled our metal with e'en two for one,  
        But Fortune's kind favor saved reedom's bold son.        Then Dighton cried out, ""Now the battle is o'er, 
          Let the French learn this lesson and teach it on shore,      
          Go back to their country and friends and take care      
          To treat well in future each prisoner of war!""            To conduct the French back we the Tiger then gave,
          Our seamen were generous and valiant and brave;          
          Then down to Antigua with our corvette we bore,          
          And on the next morning we all jumped ashore. 

          Drink a health to each seaman that ploughs the rough main.
        May each, crowned with laurels, return home again.  
        May the fair of our country some gratitude show  
        To the sons of the ocean that fight the proud foe.        And as for brave Dighton, our true valiant friend,      
        May glories pursue him while honors attend,      
        And when he does die may each seaman draw near,      
        Come kneel at his tombstone and let fall a tear "
41,The BoldPrincess Royal," On the fourteenth of February we sailed from the land In the bold Princess Royal bound for Newfoundland We had forty bright seamen our ship’s company  So boldly from the Eastward to the Westward bore we        
        We had not been sailing scarce days two or three      When a man from our topmast a sail he did see      Come bearing down on us to see where we bore      And under her mizzen black colors she bore.            

Great God cried our captain what shall we do now          Here comes a bold pirate to rob us I know          Oh no cried our chief mate that shall not be so          We will shake out our reef me boys and away from him we’ll go      
        It was the next morning at the dawning of the day  This lofty large pirate shot under our lee  Whence came you cried the pirate we answered him so  We are out of fair London bound for Callao        
        Then back your main topsails and heave your ship to For I have a letter to send down to you      

        If I back may topsail and heave my ship to      It will be for some pilot and not alongside you            
        He chased us to the Eastward all that livelong dayHe chased us to the Westward but he couldn't make no way          He fired some shots after us but none did prevail          And the bold Princess Royal soon showed him her tail     
        Oh now cried our captain the pirate is gone  Go down for your grog boys go down every one  Go down for your grog boys and be of good cheer For while we’ve got sea room bold lads never fear"

43,Boston Harbor,"From Boston harbor we set sail 
        

        And the wind was blowin' the devil of  a gale 
       
With the ring-tail set all about the  mizzen peak 

        And the dolphin striker plowin' up  the deep

44,Botany Bay,"Come all ye young men of learning  and a warning take from me  

        I would have you quit night walking  and shun bad company 

        I would have you quit night walking  er else you'll rue the day 

        You'll rue your transportation lads  when you're bound for Botany Bay 

I was brought up in London town  at a place I know full well  

        Brought up by honest parents  for the truth to tell 

        Brought up by honest parents  and reared most tenderly 

        Till I became a roving blade  which proved my destiny  
        My character was shaken  and I was sent to jail

        My friends they tried to clear me  but nothing could prevail 

        At the old Bailey sessions  the judge to me did say 
        

        The jury found you guilty lad  so you go to Botany Bay 

        It was on May the twenty eight  from England we did steer  

        And all things being safe on board  we sailed down the river clear  

        And every 
        ship that we passed by  we heard the sailors say 

        Good thing it's them not us - Ho- Ho  that are bound for Botany Bay  
        There is a girl in Manchester  a girl I know quite well 

        And if I ever get set free  with her I intend to dwell 
Which means, I mean to marry her  And no more go astray 

        I'll shun all evil company  
    bid adieu to Botany Bay

          For once there was a Black Ball ship,

        That fourteen knots an hour could slip, 
          Hurrah for the Black Ball Line!

          Her yards were square, her gear all new 
        Hurrah for the Black Ball Line!
        She had a good and gallant crew, 
          Hurrah for the Black Ball Line!

          One day whilst sailing on the sea, 
        Hurrah for the Black Ball Line!
          They saw a vessel on their lee, 
          Hurrah for the Black Ball Line!

          They knew it was a pirate craft, 
          All armed with guns before and aft,
          
          She fired a shot across their bow, 
        Hurrah for the Black Ball Line!Which was not kind you must allow,

          They did not fear as you may think 
          Hurrah for the Black Ball Line!
But made the pirates water drink, 
          Hurrah for the Black Ball Line!          
          They gave that vessel their sharp stem,
          Hurrah for the Black Ball Line!And cut her through; more praise to them,
          Hurrah for the Black Ball  Line!          
          They seized the pirates' wicked mate,

          The skipper and his wicked crew, 
          Hurrah for the Black Ball Line!
They sunk beneath the waters blue, 
          Hurrah for the Black Ball Line!          
          It was a plucky thing to do 
          Hurrah for the Black Ball Line!
To cut the Pirate vessel through, 
          Hurrah for the Black Ball Line!          
          Then drink success to the Black Ball Line, 
          Hurrah for the Black Ball Line!
          Their ships are good, their men are fine. 
          Hurrah for the Black Ball Line!          
          In the Black Ball Line I served my time,

            (Not forgetting our glorious King)

            He always did good tidings bring,

            For he was a bold commander.


            There was Sydney Smith and Duncan too, 

            Lord Howe and all the glorious crew;

            They were the men that were true blue.

            Full of care, yet I swear

            None with Nelson could compare,          Not even Alexander.

Bold Buonaparte he threaten'd war,

          A man who fear'd not wound nor scar,

          But still he lost at Trafalgar 


          Where Britain was victorious.

          Lord Nelson's actions made him quake, 

          And all French pow'rs he made to shake;

          He said his king he'd ne'er forsake. 

          These last words thus he spake,

          Stand true, my lads, like hearts of oak, 

          And the battle shall be glorious.


          Lord Nelson bold, though threaten'd wide, 

          And many a time he had been tried,

          He fought like a hero till he died 

          Amid the battle gory.

          But the day was won, their line was broke, 

          While all around was lost in smoke,

          And Nelson he got his death-stroke, 

          That's the man for old England!
He faced his foe with his sword in hand 

          And he lived and he died in his glory.

          Where the sun it never sets, my lads, nor darkness dims the sky.

          CHORUS
          So it's cheer up, my lads, 
          Let your hearts never fail,
          For the bonny ship, The Diamond, 
          goes a-fishing for the whale.

          Along the quay at Peterhead, the lasses stand around,
          With their shawls all pulled about them and the salt tears running down;
          Don't you weep, my bonny lass, though you be left behind,
          For the rose will grow on Greenland's ice 
          before we change our mind

          CHORUS

          Here's health to The Resolution, likewise The Eliza Swan,
          Here's health to The Battler of Montrose 
          and The Diamond, ship of fame;
          We wear the trousers of the white
and the jackets of the blue,
          When we return to Peterhead we'll ha'e sweethearts enoo.  

          CHORUS

          It'll be bright both day and night  
          when the Greenland lads come hame,
          With a ship that's fu' o' oil, my lads, and money to our name;
          We'll make the cradles for to rock and the blankets for to tear,
          And every lass in Peterhead sing, ""Hushabye, my dear"".

55,British Man O War,"It was down in yonder meadow  I carelessly did stray
          There I beheld a lady fair  All with a sailor gay  
          He said, My lovely fair maid,  I soon must leave this shore 
        To cross the briny ocean  In a British Man-of-War              
Fair Susan fell to weeping  Young sailor"" she did say 
        Oh do not be so venturesome  As to throw your life away  
        For when that I am twenty-one I shall receive my store 
        So I pray you do not venture  On a British Man-of-War    
        
Oh, Susan lovely Susan  The truth to you I'll tell  
        The British Flag insulted is  All England knows it well  
        I may be crowned with laurels  All like some jolly tar 
        So I'll face the walls of China  In a British Man-of-War    
        
Oh do not be so venturesome  As to face the cruel Chinese
        For they will prove as treacherous  As any Portuguese  
        And by some deadly dagger  You may receive a scar 
        So William do not venture  On a British Man-of-War    
Oh Susan lovely Susan  The time will quickly pass  
        Will you come to the Ferry-House To take a parting glass  
        For my ship-mates they are ready  To row me from the shore 
        And I'll fight for England's glory  In a British Man-of-War    
Then he took out his handkerchief And he tore it clean in two  
        Saying, Take this dearest Susan  And I'll do the same by you  
        When the bullets they surround me And the cannons they do roar 
        I'll fight for Fame and Susan  On a British Man-of-War "

60,Can Of Grog,"1700'scourtesy of www.SailorSongs.comWhen up the shrouds the sailor goes  
          
          And ventures on the yard
          The landsman who no better know           
          Believe his lot is hard
          Bold Jack with smiles each danger meets           
          Weighs anchor heaves the log
          Trims all the sails belays his sheets           
          And drinks his can of grog

          If to engage they give the word           
          To quarters he'll repair
          Now winding in the dismal flood           
          Now quivering in the air
          When waves 'gainst rocks to rend and roar           
          You'll n'er hear him repine
          Though he's on Greenland's icy shore

          When sailing orders to arrive

          My dear sweetest Pol he cries  I pray now do not grieve
        Thy Jack will take his daily can           
        Of grog and drink to thee
        In hopes that thou will n'er forget 
        Thy sailor who's at sea

        But should thou false or fickle prove  
        To Jack who loves thee dear
        No more upon my native shore  
        Can I with joy appear
        But restless as the briny main           
        Must heartless heave the log
        Shall trim the sails and try to drown           
        My sorrow in cans of grog"
61,Can You Dance The Polka / New York Girls,"As I walked out on South Street, a fair maid I  did meet
      Who asked me please to see her home she lived on Bleecker Street

CHORUS
      And away, you Johnny, my dear honey
      Oh you New York girls, you love us for our money

      I said, ""My dear young lady, I'm a stranger here in town
      I left my ship just yesterday, from Liverpool I was bound.""

      I took her out to Tiffany's, I spared her no expense
      I bought her two gold earrings, they cost me fifteen cents.

      She said, ""Come with me, Dearie, I'll stand you to a treat
      I'll buy you rum and brandy, dear, and tab-nabs for to eat.""

      And when we reached the barroom, boys, the drinks was handed round
      That liquor was so awful strong, my head went round and round.

      When the drinking it was over, we straight to bed did go
      And little did I ever think she'd prove my overthrow

      When I came to next morning, I had an aching head
      And there was I, Jack-all-alone, stark naked on the bed

      I looked all around the room, but nothing could I see
      But a lady's shift and apron which now belonged to me

      Everything was silent, the hour was eight o'clock
      I put my shift and apron on and headed for the dock

      My shipmates seeing me come aboard, these words to me did say
      ""well well, old chap, you've lost your cap since last you went away.""

      ""Is this the new spring fashion the ladies wear ashore?
      Where is the shop that sells it? Have they got any more?""

      The Old Man cried, ""Why Jack, my boy, I'm sure I could have found
      A better suit than that, by far, to buy for eighty pounds.""

      So come all you bully sailormen, take warning when ashore
      Or else you'll meet some charming girl who's nothing but a whore

      Your hard-earned cash will disappear, your rig and boots as well
      For Yankee girls are tougher than the other side of Hell

          My name is William Kidd, God's laws I did forbid
          And most wickedly I did, as I sailed, as I sailed

          Oh, my parents taught me well, as I sailed, as I sailed
          My parents taught me well, as I sailed
          My parents taught me well to shun the gates of Hell

          I murdered William Moore, as I sailed
          I murdered William Moore and I left him in his gore

          Oh I steered from sound to sound, as I sailed

          I was sick and nigh to death, as I sailed
          I was sick and nigh to death and I vowed with every breath
          To walk in wisdom's ways when I sailed, when I sailed

          My repentance lasted not, as I sailed, as I sailed
          My repentance lasted not, as I sailed
          My repentance lasted not, my vows I soon forgot
          Damnation was my lot, as I sailed, as I sailed

          To execution dock I must go
          To execution dock, while many thousands flock
          But I must bear the shock and must die, and must die,

          Take a warning now by me, for I must die, for I must die,
          Take a warning now by me for I must die
          Take a warning now by me and shun bad company,

67,The Coast Of High Barbaree,"Look ahead, look a stern,
        look the weather in  the lee,
        Blow high! Blow low! and so sailed we.
        I see a wreck to the windward 
        and a lofty ship to lee,
        A sailing down all on the coasts of High Barbary

        O are you a pirate or a man-o-war? cried we.
        Blow high! Blow low! and so sailed we.
        O no! I'm not a pirate but a man-o-war, cried he.
        A sailing down all on the coasts of High Barbary

        We'll back up our topsails and heave our vessel to;
        Blow high! Blow low! and so sailed we.
        For we have got some letters 
        to be carried home by you.
        A sailing down all on the coasts of High Barbary

        For broadside, for broadside 
        they fought all on the main;
        Blow high! Blow low! and so sailed we. 
        Until at last the frigate shot the pirate's mast away.
        A sailing down all on the coasts of High Barbary

        For quarters! For quarters! the saucy pirates cried,
        Blow high! Blow low! and so sailed we.
        The quarters that we showed them 
        Was to sink them in the tide.
        A sailing down all on The coasts of High Barbary

        With cutlass and gun, O we fought for hours three;
        Blow high! Blow low! and so sailed we.
        The ship it was their coffin and their grave it was the sea.

      G                                                    D7
      ’Twas there that I first met sweet Molly Malone

             G                                                 D7                    
      She wheeled her wheelbarrow through streets broad  and narrow



        G                                                             D7   G
 Crying, “cockels and mussels alive, alive-o”

G                           D7
Alive, alive-o, alive, alive-o 

G                                                      D7           G
        Crying, “cockels and mussels  alive, alive-o


G                                         D7
        She was a fishmonger, but sure ’twas no wonder

        G                                        D7
        For so were her father and mother before

        G                                                            
        And they each wheeled their barrow

                 D7 
      through streets broad and narrow  

CHORUS"
69,The Common Sailor,"I'm the man before the mast          That ploughs the raging sea  
          And on this simple subject          Will you please enlighten me 

          Common sailors we are called          Come tell me the reason why 
          And on this simple subject I'll reply 
CHORUS sung after each verse  Don't you call us common sailors anymore 
        Don't you call us common sailors  anymore 

        Good things to you we bring 
        Don't you call us common men 
        We're as good as anybody that's on shore 

The young girls of this country          Their  growing days we bless 
          We brings them silks and satins          Out of which they makes a dress 

          To gain the heart of some young man          As fancy dresses do 
          Don't never despise the sailor boys          That sails the ocean  blue  

The young gents of this country          They're sitting at their ease 
          Not thinking on the stormy nights          That we spent on the seas 

          We brings the leaves to make cigars          To decorate their face 
          They wouldn't call us common          If they were sometimes in our place 

When speaking of a man ashore          We never  hear you say 
          He's a common this or common that          Be his calling what it may 

          Be he a traveling tinker          Or a scavenger, or a sweep 
          Then why call us common sailors          Who battle with the deep"
70,The Constitution and The Guerriere ,"It oft-times has been told 
          That the British seamen bold
          Could flog the tars of France
          So neat and handy Oh
          But they never met their match
          Till the Yankees did them catch
          Oh the Yankee boys for fighting
          Are the dandy Oh

          The Guerriere a frigate bold,          On the foaming ocean rolled
          Commanded by proud Dacres          The grandee Oh
          With as choice a British crew          As ever a rammer drew
          Could flog the Frenchmen
          Two to one so handy Oh

          When the frigate hove in view,          Says proud Dacres to his crew
          Come clear the ship for action          And be handy Oh
          To the weather-gage boys get her          And to make his men fight better
          Gave them to drink gunpowder          Mixed with brandy Oh

          Then Dacres loudly cries          Make this Yankee ship your prize
          You can in thirty minutes          Neat and handy Oh
          Twenty-five's enough, I'm sure          And if you'll do it in a score
          I'll treat you to a double          Share of brandy Oh

          The British shot flew hot          Which the Yankees answered not
          Till they got within the distance          They called handy Oh
          Now says Hull unto his crew          Let us see what we can do
          If we take this boasting Briton          We're the dandy Oh

          The first broadside we poured          Carried her mainmast by the board
          Which made this lofty frigate          Look abandoned Oh
          Then Dacres shook his head          And to his officers said
          Lord I didn't think those Yankees          Were so handy Oh

          Our second told so well          That their fore and mizzen fell
          Which doused the royal ensign          Neat and handy Oh
          By George says he We're done          And they fired a lee gun
          While the Yankees struck up          Yankee Doodle Dandy Oh

          Then Dacres came on board          To deliver up his sword
          Though loth was he to part with it          It was so handy Oh
          Oh Keep your sword says Hull          For it only makes you dull
          Cheer up and let us have          A little brandy Oh

          Now fill your glasses full          And we'll drink to Captain Hull
          And so merrily we'll push          Around the brandy Oh
          Johnny Bull may boast his fill          Let the world say what it will
          The Yankee boys for fighting          Are the dandy Oh "
71,Crossing The Bar ,"Sunset and evening star          

            And one clear call for me

            And may there be no moaning of the bar

            When I put out to sea


            But such a tide as moving seems asleep

            Too full for sound and foam

            When that which drew from out the boundless deep

            Turns again home


          Twilight and evening bell          

          And after that the dark

          And may there be no sadness of farewell

          When I embark
        For though from out our bourne of Time and Place

        The flood may bear me far

        I hope to see my Pilot face to face

        When I have crossed the bar"
72,The Cumberland and The Merrimack,"Come all my jolly seamen, Likewise you landsmen too.
        It is a dreadful story I will unfold to you
        It's all about the Cumberland, 
        The ship so  true and brave 
        And it's many the loyal seamen That met a watery  grave.       It was early in the morning, Just at the break of  day, 
      When our good ship  the Cumberland lay anchored in the bay
      When the man from on  the lookout down to the rest did say: 
          There is something like a housetop to the larboard she  does lay

          Then our captain took his telescope and he gazed far o'er the blue. 
      Turning 'round he said as follows  to his brave and loyal crew: 
      That thing you see over yonder just like a turtle's back, 
      Is that cursed Rebel steamer they call the Merrimac          Then our decks were cleared for action each gun was pointed true
          But still that Rebel steamer came  steaming o'er the blue
          And on she kept a-coming till no distance did  us part,
        When she sent a ball a-humming that stilled  the beat of many's the heart.           In vain we poured our broadsides 
          Into her ribs of steel
          But still no breach  was in her no damage did she feel
          Up stepped the Rebel  commander in a voice of thunder spoke
          Pull down your flying  colors 
        Or I'll sink your Yankee boat          Then our captain's eyes did glisten his face grew pale with rage, 
          And in a voice of thunder to the Rebel commander said
          My crew is brave and loyal and by me they will stand
        And before I'll strike my colors You can sink me an be damned          Then this ironclad she left us a hundred yards or more
          The screeching and screaming of her  balls, our wooden sides she tore
          She struck us right amidships her ram  went crashing through
        And the waters they came pouring in on  the brave and loyal crew          Then our captain turned unto his men and unto  them did say
          I'll not leave  the Cumberland while she does ride the wave
It's you,  my loyal comrades may seek your lives to save
        But I'll  go down with my gallant ship for to meet a watery grave          They swore that they'd not leave her and manned the guns afresh
        And broadside after broadside poured till the waters reached their breasts 
        And as they down went sinking down in the briny deep
        The Stars and Stripes still floated from the maintop's highest peak"
73,Dance To Your Daddy,"Dance to your   daddy           My little laddie

          Dance to your daddy
          My little man


          Thou shalt   have a fish
          Thou shalt have a fin

          Thou shalt have a haddock           When the   boat comes in


          Thou shalt have a codling          
          Boiled in a pan

          She shall be your   lassie          Thou shalt be her man

          Dance to your daddy          My little lamb"
74,The Dark Eyed Sailor ,"There was a comely young lady fair She was walking out for to take the air
          She met a sailor down by the way          So I paid attention so I paid attention
          To hear what they would say.2   
          Said William Lady why main alone          The night is coming and the day's near gone
          She said, while tears from her eyes did fall          It's a dark-eyed sailor it's a dark-eyed sailor
          That's proving my downfall3   
          Tis three long years since he left the land          I took a gold ring from off my hand
          We broke the token here's part with me          While the other's rolling while the other's rolling
          At the bottom of the sea4
          Said William Lady drive him from your mind          Some other sailor as good you'll find
          Love turns aside and soon cold does grow          Like a winter's morning like a winter's morning
          When lands are clothed with snow5
          These words did Phoebe's fond heart inflame:
          She said On me you shall play no game
          She drew a dagger, and then did cry          For my dark-eyed sailor for my dark-eyed sailor
          A maid I'll live and die6
          His coal-black eyes and his curly hair          His pleasing tongue did my heart ensnare
          Genteel he was and no rake like you          To advise a maiden to advise a maiden
          To slight the jacket blue7
          But still said Phoebe I'll ne'er disdain          A tarry sailor but treat the same
          Go drink his health here's a piece of coin          But my dark-eyed sailor but my dark-eyed sailor
          Still claims this heart of mine8 
          Then half the ring did young William show          She seemed distracted 'twixt joy and woe
          Says Welcome William I've got lands and gold          For my dark-eyed sailor for my dark-eyed sailor
          So manly true and bold                                              
          9                                                                                  
          Now in a village down by the sea          They're joined in wedlock and well agree
          So maids be true when your love's away 
          For a cloudy morning for a cloudy morning
          Oft brings forth a pleasant day"
75,The Dead Horse,"
          They say old man your horse will die   
          And  they say so and they hope so

Oh poor old man your horse will die   
          
          Oh  Poor old man
For many days I've ridden him   
        
        And  they say so and they hope so 

      
        And when he dies I'll tan his skin   
      
        Oh  poor old man
          And if he lives I'll ride him again  

        And they say so and they hope so

I'll ride him with a tighter rein  
       
        Oh  poor old horse

    
        It's up aloft the horse must go  
     
        They  say so and they hope
We'll hoist him up and bury him low  
Oh  poor old horse"

77,The Dogger Bank,"Sailing over the Dogger Bank, 
wasn't it a treat   
         
        The wind a-blowing 'bout east-nor'east  
        so we had to give her sheet; 

You ought to see us rally, the wind a-blowing free

        On passage from the Dogger Bank to Great Grimsby. 
        CHORUS sung after each verse

So watch her, trigger the proper ju-ber-ju, 
        

        Give her sheet and let  her rip 

        We're the boys to pull her through, 
        

        You ought to have seen us rally

        The wind a-blowing free, 
        on passage

        From the Dogger Bank
        To Great Grimsby

Now our captain he's a shang-a-roosh, 
        he likes  a drop of good ale

        Our mate he's a roadstone prat inspector,
He's  been seen in many a goalOur third hand he's a bushranger, 
        he come on  deck and received the mail

        And you give a look at our old cook 
        he's so  hoppity wild Now we are the boys to make a noise
when we  come home from sea

We get right drunk and roll on the floor 
          and cause a jubilee

        We get right drunk and full of beer,
we roll all over the floor

And when our rent it is all spent, 
      We'll  go to sea for more."
78,Down To Hilo ,"from the 1600'scourtesy of www.SailorSongs.comOh Tommy's gone what shall I do  

        Away down Hilo

        Oh Tommy's gone and I'll go too 

Tom's gone to Hilo

          Oh I love Tom and he loves me 

        Away down Hilo 

        He thinks of me when out to sea  

        Tom's gone to Hilo

      Oh away around to Callao Away down Hilo
The Spanish girls he'll see I know  Tom's gone to Hilo
          Tommy's gone what shall I do  Away down  Hilo 
Oh Tommy fought at Trafalgar  Tom's gone to Hilo

      The Old Victory led the way Away down Hilo 
The brave Old Victory led the way Tom's gone to Hilo

      Tommy's gone for evermore Away down Hilo 
I'll never see my Tom no more Tom's gone to Hilo"
79,The Dreadnaught ,"There's a saucy wild packet, and a packet of  fame;
          She belongs to New York, and the Dreadnought's her name;
          She is bound to the westward where the stormy winds blow;
          Bound away in the Dreadnought, to the west'ard we'll go.

          There time of her sailing is now drawing nigh;
          Farewell, pretty May, I must bid you good-bye;
          Farewell to old England and all there we hold dear,
          Bound away in the Dreadnought, to the west'ard we'll steer.

          Oh, the Dreadnought is pulling out of Waterlock dock,
          Where the boys and girls to the pierheads do flock;
          They will give us three cheers while their tears do flow,
          Saying, ""God bless the Dreadnought, where'er she may go!""

          Oh, the Dreadnought is waiting in the Mersey so free,
          Waiting for the Independence to tow her to sea,
          For around that rock light where the Mersey does flow,
          Bound away in the Dreamings, to the westward we'll go.

          Oh, the Dreadnought's a-bowlin' down the wild Irish Sea,
          Where the passengers are merry, their hearts full of glee,
          While her sailors like lions walk the decks to and fro,
          She's the Liverpool packet, oh, Lord, let her go!

          Oh, the Dreadnought's a-sailing the Atlantic so wide,
          While the dark, heavy seas roll along her black sides,
          With her sails neatly spread, and the Red Cross to show,
          She's the Liverpool packet, oh Lord, let her go!

          Oh, the Dreadnought's becalmed on the banks of Newfoundland,
          Where the water's so green and the bottom is sand;
          Where the fish of the ocean swim round to and fro,
          She's the Liverpool packet, oh Lord, let her go!

          Oh, the Dreadnought, she's a-bowlin' past old Nantucket Head,
          And the man in chains takes a cast with the lead,
          The up jumps the flounder just fresh from the ground,
          Crying, ""Blast your eyes, Chucklehead and mind where you sound!""

          Oh, the Dreadnought's arrived in America once more,
          We'll go ashore, shipmates, on the land we adore,
          See our wives and our sweethearts, be merry and free,
          Drink a health to the Dreadnought, whereso'er she may be.

          Here's a health to the Dreadnought, and to all her brave crew.
          Here's a health to her captain and officers too.
          Talk about your flash packets, Swallow Tail and Black Ball,
      But the Dreadnought's the clipper to beat one and all. "
80,Drunken Sailor,"This song is a sea shanty. Sea shanties were work songs. Folk songs of the sailors. Books of songs are available but you can get the music for the song here. There are books of sea shanties available on the sailorsongs sea shanty store.

On the compact disc recording of this sea chanty song I have used a lot of different musical instruments. One nice thing about being here is the link to the store where you can buy recordings of my two cd's as either regular compact discs of sea shanties or download the songs individually. 

Also available are recordings of sea shanties or sea chanties as they are sometimes called by other folk singers and chantymen. The lyrics for those folks who don't need the sheet music. Sing sea shanties by the seashore, it's good fun!  Hear a sample of the song using the device in the Sea Shanty Store.

81,The Ebenezer,"
          I shipped on board of the Ebenezer   Every  day you scrub and grease herSend us aloft to scrape her down  And if  we growl they’ll knock us down
Oh get along boys get along do Be han–dy boys be han-dy
          Our first mates name was Dickie Green, Sir,  The dirtiest man you ever seen sirWalkin’ the quarter with a bucko cap  He  thought himself no common chap  CHORUS
          A Boston buck for second greaser,  He used to ship in Limejuice greasersThe lime juice greasers got to hot;  He  made a jump for Boston dock   CHORUS
          We had no spuds for our dinner  As sure as I’m a livin’ sin-nerOur bread was tough as any brass  Our meat  was as salty as Lot’s wife’s ass

82,The Edmund Fitzgerald,"The legend lives on from the Chippewa on down  Of the big lake they call Gitchigumi 
        The lady, it's said, never gives up her dead  When the skies of November turn gloomy. With a load of iron ore26,000 tons more  Than the Edmund Fitzgerald weighed empty 
        That good ship and crew  was a bone to be chewed  When the gales of November came early The ship was the pride of the American side  Coming back from some mill in Wisconsin  
        As the big freighters go it was bigger than most  With a crew and the Captain well seasoned. Concluding some terms with a couple of steel firms  When they left fully loaded for Cleveland
        And later that night when the ships bell rang  Could it be the North Wind they'd been feeling. The wind in the wires made a tattletale sound  When the wave broke over the whaling  
        And every man knew, as the Captain did, too,  T'was the witch of November come stealing. The dawn came late and the breakfast had to wait  When the gales of November came slashing  
        When afternoon came it was freezing rain  In the face of a hurricane West Wind When supper time came the old cook came on deck  Saying fellows it's too rough to feed ya  
        At 7PM the main hatchway gave in  He said fellas it's been good to know ya. The Captain wired in he had water coming in  And the good ship and crew was in peril  
        And later that night when his lights went out of sight  Came the wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald. Does anyone know where the love of God goes  When the words turn the minutes to hours  
        The searchers all say they'd have made Whitefish Bay  If they'd fifteen more miles behind her. They might have split up or they might have capsized  They may have gulfed deep and took water  
        And all that remains is the faces and the names  Of the wives and the sons and the daughters. Lake Huron rolls, Superior sings  
        In the ruins of her ice water mansion  
        Ole Michigan steams like a young man's dreams,  The islands and bays are for sportsmen. And farther below Lake Ontario  Takes in what Lake Erie can send her  
        The iron boats go as the mariners all know  With the gales of November remembered. In a musty old hall in Detroit they prayed  In the Maritime Sailors' Cathedral  
        The church bell chimed, it rang 29 times  For each man on the Edmund Fitzgerald. The legend lives on from the Chippewa on down  Of the big lake they call Gitchigumi  
        Superior, they say, never gives up her dead  When the gales of November come early."
83,Eight Bells,"from the 1870scourtesy of www.SailorSongs.com My husband's a saucy foretop man,
          A chum of the cooks, don't you know?
          He put his head down the cook's funnel,
          And shouted, ""come up from below.""
          Eight bells, Eight bells,
          Rouse out there the watch from below;
          Eight bells, eight bells,
          Rouse out there the watch from below.

          My husband once shipped in a whaler,
          And sailed to the far Northern Seas;
          But being a bold-hearted sailor,
          He cared not for ice, sea, nor breeze.
          Eight bells, Eight bells,
          Rouse out there the watch from below;
          Eight bells, eight bells,
          Rouse out there the watch from below.

          At the end of each watch though his fancy
          Was to get to his bunk quickly, oh!
          For he wanted to dream of his Nancy,
          So called to the watch, ""hi below!""
          Eight bells, Eight bells,
          Rouse out there the watch from below;
          Eight bells, eight bells,
          Rouse out there the watch from below.

          But now he's no longer a sailor
          He often wakes up in the night
          And thinking he's still on the whaler
          Calls out with the greatest delight-
          Eight bells, Eight bells,
          Rouse out there the watch from below;
          Eight bells, eight bells,
          Rouse out there the watch from below."

          Our time is short, remember,

        For tonight we'll merry, merry be, 
        For tonight we'll merry, merry be,
        For tonight we'll merry, merry be,        Tomorrow we'll be sober.


        Farewell old rye, 'tis a sad, sad word        But alas! it must be spoken,

        For tonight we'll merry, merry be,        Tomorrow we'll be sober.


        Yet memory oft' will backward turn,        And dwell with fondness partial,
        On the days when gin was not a sin,        Nor cocktails brought courts-martial.

        For tonight we'll merry, merry be,        For tonight we'll merry, merry be,
        For tonight we'll merry, merry be,         Tomorrow we'll be sober.


        All hands to splice the main brace, call,        But splice it now in sorrow
        For the spirit-room key will be laid away         Forever, on tomorrow.

88,The Faithful Sailor Boy,"Twas on a dark and stormy night                The snow lay on the ground  A sailor boy stood on the deck  The ship was outward bound  His sweetheart standing by his side  Shed many a bitter tear  At last he pressed her to his heart  And whispered in her ear CHORUS 
        Farewell, farewell, my own true love;                 This parting gives me pain.                 You'll be my own, my guiding star                 Until I return again.

'Twas in a gale that ship set-sail  The girl still standing by  She watched the ship clear out of sight  While tears bedimmed her eyes  She prayed to God in heaven above  To guide him on his way  The parting words her lover spoke  Re-echoed down the bay...(First CHORUS) "
89,The Female Smuggler," O come list a while, and you shall hear
          By the rolling sea lived a maiden fair
          Her father had followed the smuggling trade
          Like a war-like hero
          Like a warlike hero that never was afraid

          Now, in sailor's clothing young Jane did go
          Dressed like a sailor from top to toe
          Her aged father was the only care
          O this female smuggler
          Of this female smuggler who never did despair

          With her pistols loaded she went aboard
          And by her side hung a glittering sword
          In her belt two daggers well armed for war
          Was this female smuggler
          Was this female smuggler who never feared a scar

          Now they had not sailed far from the land
          When a strange sail brought them to a stand.
          'These are sea robbers this maid did cry
          'But the female smuggler
          But the female smuggler will conquer or will die

          Alongside then this strange vessel came
          Cheer up,' cried Jane we will board the same
          We'll run all chances to rise or fall
          Cried this female smuggler
          Cried this female smuggler who never feared a ball

          Now they killed those pirates and took their store
          And soon returned to old Eng-a-land's shore
          With a keg of brandy she walked along
          Did this female smuggler
          Did this female smuggler and sweetly sang a song

          Now they were followed by the blockade
          Who in irons strong did put this fair maid
          But when they brought her for to be tried
          This young female smuggler
          This young female smuggler stood dressed like a bride

          Their commodore against her appeared
          And for her life she did greatly fear
          When he did find to his great surprise
          'Twas a female smuggler
          'Twas a female smuggler had fought him in disguise

          He to the judge and the jury said
          'I cannot prosecute this maid
          Pardon for her on my knees I crave
          For this female smuggler
          For this female smuggler so valiant and so brave

          Then this commodore to her father went
          To gain her hand he asked his consent.
          His consent he gained so the commodore
          And the female smuggler												   And the female smuggler are one for evermore."

92,The Fire Ship,"As I strolled out one evening, out for a  night's career,

        I spied a lofty ship and after her did steer.

        I hoisted her my signals which she very quickly knew;

        And when she seed my bunting fly she immediately hove to. CHORUS

        She's a dark and  rolling eye, 

  And her hair hung down in ring-o-lets.
  

  She was a  nice girl, a decent girl,
But one of the rakish kind 
  O, sir, you must excuse me for being out so  late, 

  For if my parents knew of it, sad would be my fate.

  My father he's a minister, a good and honest man,  

  My mother she's a Methodist, and I do the best I can.....CHORUS
I took her to a tavern and I treated her to  wine,

  Little did I think she belonged to the rakish kind.

  I handled her, I dandled her, and found to my surprise,

  She was nothing but a fires ship, rigged up in a disguise.   CHORUS"

94,The Flash Frigate," I sing of a frigate, a frigate of fame
          And in the West Indies she bore a  great nameFor cruel, hard treatment of every  degree
          Like slaves in the galleys we  ploughed the salt sea
          At four in the morning our day's work begun
      Come, lash up your hammocks, boys,  every oneSeven turns with the lashing so  neatly must show
        And all of one size through a hoop  they must showThe next thing we do is to holystone  the decks
        Mizzen-topmen from the forehatch  their buckets must fetchAnd its fore and main topmen so  loudly they bawl
          Come, fetch up your holystones,  squilgees and all
 The decks being scrubbed and  the rigging coiled down
        It's clean up your bright work which  is found all aroundYour gun-caps and aprons so neatly  must shine
        And in white frocks and trousers you  must all toe the line          The next thing we hear is ""All hands to make sail
          Way aloft!"" and ""Lay  out!"" and ""Let fall!"" is the hail O, your royals and your skysails and  moonsails so high
        At the sound of the call your  skyscrapers must flyBut now, my brave boys, comes the  best of the fun
        All hands about ship and reef  topsails in oneO, it's ""lay aloft, topmen,""  as the helm goes down
        And it's ""clew down your  topsails,""        as the mainyard swings round          Trice up, and lay out, and take two snug reefs in one
          And all in one moment this work must  be doneThen man your head braces,  topsail-halyards and all
        And hoist away topsails as you let go  and haulOur second lieutenant, you all know  him well
        He comes up on deck and cuts a great  swellO, it's ""bear a hand here,""  and ""bear a hand there
          And at the lee gangway he serves out  our share

        Now, all your bold seaman who plough  the salt sea
        Beware this frigate wherever she beFor they'll beat you and bang you  till you ain't worth a damn
        And send you an invalid to your own  native land "
95,The Flying Cloud,"My name is Arthur Hollandin, as you may understand         
          I was born ten miles from Dublin  Town, 
        down on the salt-sea strand, 
        When I was young and' comely, sure,  good fortune on me shone
        My parents loved me tenderly for I  was their only son.
          My father he rose up one day and with him I did go
          He bound me as a butcher's boy to  Pearson of Wicklow
          I wore the bloody apron there for  three long years and more
          Till I shipped on board of the Ocean  Queen Belonging to Tramore
          It was on Bermuda's island That I met with Captain Moore
          The Captain of The Flying Cloud, The  pride of Baltimore
          I undertook to ship with him On a  slaving voyage to go
          To the burning shores of Africa,  Where the sugar cane does grow
          It all went well until the day we reached old Africa's shore
          And five hundred of them poor slaves,  me boys from their native land we bore
          Each man was loaded down with chains  as we made them walk below
          Just eighteen inches of space was all  that each man had to show
          The plague it came and fever too and killed them off like flies
          We dumped their bodies on the deck and  hove them over side
          For sure, the dead were the lucky  ones for they'd have to weep no more
          Nor drag the chain and feel the lash  In slavery for evermore
          But now our money it is all spent, We must go to sea once more
          And all but five remained to listen to  the words of Captain Moore
          There's gold and silver to be had If  with me you'll remain
          Let's hoist the pirate flag aloft and  sweep the Spanish Main
          The Flying Cloud was a Yankee ship, five hundred tons or more
          She could outsail any clipper ship hailing  out of Baltimore
          With her canvas white as the driven  snow And on it there's no specks
          And forty men and fourteen guns she  carried below her decks
          We plundered many a gallant ship down on the Spanish Main
          Killed many a man and left his wife and  children to remain
          To none we showed no kindness but  gave them watery graves
          For the saying of our captain was:  ""Dead men tell no tales."" 
          We ran and fought with many a ship both frigates and liners too
          Till, at last, a British man-o-war, The  Dunmow, hove in view
          She fired a shot across our bows as  we ran before the wind
          And a chainshot cut our mainmast down  and we fell far behind
          They beat our crew to quarters as they drew up alongside 
          And soon across our quarter-deck there ran a crimson tide 
          We fought until they killed our  captain and twenty of our men
           Then a bombshell set our ship  on fire, We had to surrender then
          It's now to Newgate we have come bound down with iron chains 
          For the sinking and the plundering of  ships on the Spanish Main
           The judge he has condemned us and  we are condemned to die
           Young men a warning by me Take  and shun all piracy


          Farewell to Dublin City and the girl that I adore
          I'll never kiss your cheek again nor  hold your hand no more
          Whiskey and bad company have made a  wretch of me
          Young men, a warning by me take and  shun all piracy

96,The Gals of Dublin Town,"Now, 'tis of a famous Yankee ship, to New York we waz bound,

                And our cap'n bein' an Irish man belongin' to Dub-a-lin Town,


                Hoorah! Hoorah! for the gals o' Dub-a-lin Town,

                Hoorah for the bonnie green flag, an' the Harp wi'out th' Crown!


                An' when he gazes on that land, that town of high renown,

                Oh, it's break away the green burgee and the 
                Harp without the Crown


                'Twas on the seventeenth o' March, we arrived in New York Bay,

                Our Cap'n bein' an Irishman must celebrate the day.


                With the Stars an' Stripes 'way high aloft, an' fluttering all around,

                But underneath his monkey-gaff flew the Harp without the Crown


                Now we're bound for 'Frisco, boys, an' things is running' wild,

                The officers an' men dead drunk, around the decks they pile


                But by tamorra mornin', boys, we'll work wit out a frown,

              For on board the saucy Shenandoah flies the Harp without the Crown!"

98,The Girl I Left Behind Me,"The dames of France are fond and free  and Flemish lips are willingAnd soft the maids of Italy And Spanish eyes are thrilling

Still, though I bask beneath their  smile Their charms fail to bind meAnd my heart goes back to Erin's Isle To the girl I left behind me
        For she's as fair as Shannon's side And purer than its waterBut she refused to be my bride Though many years I sought her

Yet, since to France I sailed away Her letters oft remind meThat I promised never to gainsay The girl I left behind me   


        She says: ""My own dear love come home My friends are rich and manyOr else, abroad with you I'll roam A soldier stout as any 

If you'll not come, nor let me go I'll think you have resigned meMy heart nigh broke when I answered  ""No,""To the girl I left behind me


        For never shall my true love brave A life of war and toiling 

And never as a skulking slave I'll tread my native soil on 


But were it free or to be free The battle's close would find me

To Ireland bound, nor message need From the girl I left behind me   "
99,The Glasgow,"All you who love your native land          And mean to emigrate
          A while draw near and you shall hear 
          What happened of late
          To tell the hardships I went through          Some pages it would fill
          When I was forced to leave my home          That place called Sweet Cootehill

          John Williams is my name          This truth I'll ne'er deny
          My friends they banished me away          I'll tell you the reason why 
          Because I would not break the vows          I made unto my dear
          They tore me from the arms          Of my charming Sally Greer

          Straight away to Liverpool          My friends did me convey
          And in the Glasgow to New York          My passage they did pay
          Along with Captain Robinson          And sixteen of a crew
          We set out for America          Our fortune to pursue

          'Twas on the eight of February          Our gallant ship set sail
          Bound for the city of New York          With a sweet and pleasant gale
          On the midnight of the seventh day          Before our captain went to rest
          He called unto his chief-mate          And made him this behest

          Take you charge of the vessel          And of yon rocks keep clear
          And beat about the Irish coast          Till daylight doth appear
          Our chief-mate took the orders          But he did not them obey
          And by neglect he let the ship          Go quite out of her way

          Early the following morning          About half-past four o'clock
          Our gallant ship with all her might          Came on a sunken rock
          These rocks are called The Barrels          They're hidden from human sight
          They lie abreast of Carnsore Head          And west of Tuskar Light

          Men, women and children          Were filled with great surprise
          A heart like flint it would relent          To hear their dismal cries
          We hoist a light from our mast-head          Before it was daylight
          And to our joy and great surprise          A schooner hove in sight

          Captain Walsh gave orders          Unto his seamen brave
          The women and the children          To strive first for to save
          With that the Glasgow gave a lurch          And none could her prevent
          And five-and-twenty fine young men          Down to the bottom went

          Long life to Captain Walsh          And to his seamen brave
          But for his assistance          We'd have met a watery grave
          He landed us in Wexford town          Where we were treated kind
          In time of need indeed 'twas there          Some warm friends we did find

          In these four months four vessels          Wrecked upon the watery main
          The Glasgow and the Mexico          The Bristol and the Jane
          And nearly a thousand passengers 
          Lie asleep in watery graves
          Men who thought to settle in land          That never sheltered slaves"
100,Go To Sea No More ,"When first I landed in Frisco Bay  I went upon a stray        
        Me money alas, I spent it fast        Got drunk as drunk could be
        And when that me money was all gone        'Twas then I wanted more
        But a man must be blind to make up his mind        
        To go to sea once more

   
        I spent the night with Angeline        Too drunk to roll in bed
        Me watch was new and me money too
        In the morning with them she fled        
        And as I walked the streets about        
        The whores they all did roar
        There goes Jack Strapp the poor sailor lad,        
        He must go to sea once more 


  
        And as I walked the streets about        I met with the Rapper Brown 
        I am him for to take me on        And he looked at me with a frown
        He said last time you was paid off        With me you got no score
        But I'll give you a chance and I'll take your  advance        
        And I'll send you to sea once more.

        He shipped me on board of a whaling ship 
      All for the Arctic Seas Where cold winds blow through the frost and  snow 
        And your make your own blood freeze
        But worst to bear I had no hard-weather gear
        For I'd spent all me money on shore        
        'Twas then that I wished that I was dead
And could go to sea no more 

        
        So come all ye bold seafaring men        Who listen to me song 
        When you come of them long trips        I'll have you not go wrong        
      Take my advice drink no rum        And don't go sleeping with them whores        
      Get married instead and spend all night in bed
And go to sea no more"
101,The Golden Vanity," Oh there was a lofty ship 
        and a lofty ship was she 
        And the name of that ship
        it was the Golden Vanity 
        And she feared she would be taken
      by the Turkish Enemy 

      As she sailed on the lowland, lowland low
          
As she sailed on the lowland sea 

Up stepped a little cabin boy, 
      a cabin boy was he 
      And he said to the Captain 
      what will you give to me 
      If I sneak alongside the Turkish Enemy 
      And I sink her in the lowland, lowland low 
      And I sink her in the lowland sea Oh I will give you silver and I will give you gold  
          And the hand of my daughter 
        your bonnie bride will be 
        If you'll sneak alongside of the Turkish Enemy 
        And you'll sink her in the lowland lowland low 
        And you'll sink her in the lowland sea So he jumped overboard and 
        overboard jumped he 
        And he swam alongside of the Turkish Enemy 
        And with a little drilling tool he bored holes three 
        And he sank her in the lowland lowland low 
        He sank her in the lowland sea Then he turned himself around 
        and back again swam he  '
        Til he came to the side of the Golden Vanity 
        But the Captain would not heed, 
        for his daughter he did need 
        And he left him in the lowland lowland low 
        He left him in the lowland sea Well his shipmates brought him out,        but upon the deck he died 
          
        And they wrapped him in his blanket        that was so soft and wide 
        And they cast him overboard and        he drifted with the tide 
        And he sank beneath the lowland lowland low 
        He sank beneath the lowland sea 
        And he sank beneath the lowland lowland low 
        He sank beneath the lowland sea"
102,The Good Ship Calibar,"Come all you dry land sailors and listen to me song     
        It’s only forty verses and I  won’t detain you long         
        It’s all about the adventures of  this old Lisbon tar 
          Who sailed as man before the mast 
        on  the good ship Calibar          The Calibar was a spanking craft it wasn’t rigged fore and aft
          Her helm it stuck out far behind and  her wheel 
        was a great big shaft With half a gale to fill her sail she  do one knot per hour 
          She’s the fastest barge on the  Lagan canal 
        and she’s only one horsepower

          The captain was a strapping lad and 
        he stood just four foot two 
        His eyes were black, his nose was  broke 
        and his hair was a Prussian blueHe wore a leather medal that he’d  won in the Crimea War 
          And the captain’s wife was the  passenger’s
cook on the good ship Calibar            The captain said to me me lads            ""Look here me lad"" said he 
        Would you like to be a sailor and  sail the seven seas Would you like to be a sailor and on  foreign seas to roll 
          For we’re on the way to Portadown 
          with half a ton of coal

        It was early the next morning the weather it being sublime 
        Whilst passing under the old Queen  Bridge
we heard the Albert Chime Whilst going along by the gasworks  
        straight a very dangerous part 
        We ran aground on a lump of coal that 
        wasn’t marked down on the chart          Then all became confusion and the stormy winds did blow 
          The bosun slipped on an orange peel  fell
into the hold below Put on more speed the captain cried  
        for we are sorely pressed 
        The engineer from the bank replied  
        the horse is doing his best          Then we all fell into the water and we all let out a roar 
        There was an old farmer standing  there 
        And he threw us the end of his gallooses  
        and he pulled us all ashore It’s no more I’ll be a sailor and  sail the raging main 
          And the next time I go to Portadown,
I’ll go by the bloody train"
103,The Good Ship Kangaroo,"O, once I was a waterman and lived at home at  ease,
          And now I am a mariner and plough the angry seas.

          I thought I'd like seafaring life, so bid my love adieu,
          And shipp'd as cook and steward boys, on board the Kangaroo.

          My love she was no foolish girl, her age it was two score,
          My love was not a spinster, she'd been married twice before;

          And they could not say it was her wealth That stole my heart away.
          For she was a laundry starcher at three-and-six a day.

          Oh think of me! Oh think of me! She mournfully did say,
          When you are in a foreign land, three thousand miles away;

          And take this lucky farthing, 'Twill make you bear in mind
          The loving, faithful, trusting heart you leave in tears behind.

          Cheer up! Cheer up! my own true love, don't weep so bitterly,
          But she sobbed and sighed and choked and cried and couldn't say goodbye.

          I won't be gone so very long, maybe a month or two,
          And when I do come back again, of course I'll marry you.

          Our vessel it was homeward bound from many a foreign shore.
          And many a foreign present unto my love I bore;

          There were tortoises from Teneriffe and toys from Timbuctoo,
          A Chinese rat and a Bengal cat and a Bombay cockatoo.

          Paid off, I sought her dwelling in the suburbs of the town,
          An ancient dame upon a line was hanging out a gown.

          Where is my love? she's married, sir, about six months ago,
          To a man who drives a hardware van for Johnny Fox and Co.

          Farewell to Dixon's soap suds from the famous brand called Crown,
          To Reckitt's Blue, well known to you, and Crean's Scouring Brown;

          I'll seek some far and distant clime, I can no longer stay,
          
          For my heart is now so shattered I must live on China tay.  "
104,Good Bye Fare You Well ,"Oh fare you well, I wish you well 
 Goodbye, fare you well; goodbye, fare you well  Oh fare you well, my bonny young lassies 
        Hurrah, my boys, we're homeward bound The billows roll, the breezes blow  
        Goodbye, fare you well; goodbye, fare you well To us they're calling: sheet home and go 
        Hurrah, my boys, we're homeward bound We're homeward bound, and I hear the sound, 
        Goodbye, fare you well; goodbye, fare you well So heave on the capstan and make it spin round
        Hurrah, my boys, we're homeward bound  Our anchor's aweigh and our sails they are set 
        Goodbye, fare you well; goodbye, fare you well And the girls we are leaving we leave with regret.
        Hurrah, my boys, we're homeward bound  She's a flash clipper packet and bound for to go, 
        Goodbye, fare you well; goodbye, fare you well With the girls on her towrope she cannot say no
        Hurrah, my boys, we're homeward bound"
105,Greenland Fishery,"
          'Twas in eighteen hundred and fifty-three
          And of June the thirteenth day,
          That our gallant ship her anchor weighed,
          And for Greenland bore away, brave boys,
          And for Greenland bore away.

          The lookout in the crosstrees stood,
          With his spyglass in his hand.
          There's a whale, there's a whale, there's a whale fish, he cried,
          And she blows at every span, brave boys,
          And she blows at every span.

          The captain stood on the quarter-deck,
          And a fine little man was he.
          Overhaul! Overhaul! Let your davit-tackles fall,
          And launch your boats for sea, brave boys,
          And launch your boats for sea.

          Now the boats were launched and the men aboard,
          And the whale was in full view;
          Resolv-ed was each seaman bold
          To steer where the whale fish blew, brave boys,
          To steer where the whale fish blew.

          We struck that whale, the line paid out,
          But she gave a flourish with her tail
          The boat capsized and four men were drowned,
          And we never caught that whale, brave boys,
          And we never caught that whale.

          To lose the whale,"" our captain said,
          It grieves my heart full sore
          But oh! to lose four gallant men,
          It grieves me ten times more, brave boys,
          It grieves me ten times more

          The winter star doth now appear, 
          So boys, we'll anchor weigh;
          It's time to leave this cold country, 
          And homeward bear way, brave boys,
          And homeward bear away.""

          Oh, Greenland is a dreadful place, 
          A land that's never green,
          Where there's ice and snow, and the whale fishes blow,
          And the daylight's seldom seen, brave boys,  
      And the daylight's seldom seen.        Lyrics  courtesy of www.sailorsongs.com"
106,The Grey Funnel Line,"Don't mind the rain or the rolling sea             
          The weary night never worries me
          But the hardest time in a sailor's day
          Is to watch the sun as it dies away
          Here's one more day on the Grey Funnel Line The finest ship that sails the sea
          Is still a prison for the likes of me
          But give me wings like Noah's dove
          I'll fly up harbour to the girl I love
          Here's one more day on the Grey Funnel Line >O, once my heart was wild and free
          Like a flashing spar on the open sea
          But now that spar has washed ashore
          And come to rest at my true love's door
          Here's one more day on the Grey Funnel Line Each time I gaze behind the screws
          Makes me long for Saint Peter's shoes
          I'd dance on down that Walker Shore
          And rest in my true love's arms once more
          Here's one more day on the Grey Funnel Line >O Lord if dreams were only real
          I'd feel my hands on that wooden wheel
          And with all my heart I'd turn her round
          And tell the boys that we're homeward bound
          Here's one more day on the Grey Funnel Line >I'll pass the time like some machine
          Until the waters turn to green
          Then I'll dance on down that walk ashore
          And sail the Grey Funnel Line no more
          And sail the Grey Funnel Line no more"
107,The Handsome Cabin Boy,"As you shall understand            It's of a pretty fair maid                                       She had a mind for roving Unto a foreign land Attired in sailor's clothing She boldly did appear And engaged with the captain for To serve him for a year
          She engaged with the captain A cabin boy to be The wind it was in favour They soon put out to sea The captain's lady being on board She seemed it to enjoy So glad the captain had engaged A handsome cabin boy"

          Come hang, come haul together, 
          Horray, Hooray! 

          Come hang for finer weather, 
          Hang, boys, hang.

          I'd hang a brutal mother,

          They call me hanging Johnnie
          Horray, Hooray!

          They call me hanging Johnnie,  
      Hang, boys, hang."

Heart of oak are our ships heart of oak are our men

          If they run, why we follow and run them ashore
          For if they won't fight us we cannot do more

          But should their flat bottoms in darkness get over
          Still Britons they'll find to receive them on shore  

          CHORUS

          We'll still make them fear and we'll still make them flee
          And drub 'em on shore as we've drubbed 'em at sea

          And they did cast lots which of them should go
          should go, should go          And turn robber all on the salt sea

          The lot it fell first upon Henry Martin
          The youngest of all three
          That he should turn robber all on the salt sea
          Salt sea, salt sea          For to maintain his two brothers and he

          He had not been sailing but a long winter's night
          And a part of a short winter's day
          Before he espied a stout lofty ship
          lofty ship, lofty ship          Come abiding down on him straight way

          Hullo! Hullo! cried Henry Martin
          What makes you sail so nigh
          I'm a rich merchant bound for fair London town
          London Town London Town          Will you please for to let me pass by

          Oh no! Oh no! cried Henry Martin
          That thing it never could be
          For I am turned robber all on the salt sea
          Salt sea, salt sea          For to maintain my brothers and me

          Come lower your topsail and brail up your mizzen
          And bring your ship under my lee
          Or I will give you a full flowing ball
          flowing ball flowing ball          And your dear bodies drown in the salt sea

          Oh no! we won't lower our lofty topsail
          Nor bow ourselves under your lee
          And you shan't take from us our rich merchant goods
          merchant goods merchant goods          Nor point our bold guns to the sea

          With broadside and broadside and at it they went
          For fully two hours or three
          Till Henry Martin gave to her the deathshot
          the deathshot the deathshot          And straight to the bottom went she

          Bad news bad news to old England came
          Bad news to fair London Town
          There's been a rich vessel and she's cast away
          cast away cast away      And all of the merry men drowned"

        There's nought upon the stern
        There's nought upon the lee

117,Hills Of Isle Of Haut ,"Away and to the westward
Is a place a man  should go 
Where the fishing's always easy
        They've got no ice or snow (CHORUS after each verse)

        Where the bays come together 
Bide away the days 
On the hills of Isle au Haut          Now the Plymouth girls are fine 
        They put their hearts in your hand 
        And the Plymouth boys are able 
        First-class sailors every man          Now, the trouble with old Martin 
        You don't try her in a trawler 
        For those bay of Biscay swells 
        They roll your head from off your shoulder

        Away and to the westward 
        Is a place a man should go 
        Where the fishing's always easy 
        They've got no ice or snow          Now the winters drive you crazy

   That was the news that made mothers weep
 For the sons who had fought for a country so proud  
        Were down there below with the sea as their shroud

      They're sleeping in heavenly peace, sleeping in heavenly peace
Then came George V, the Prince of Wales too       They took in hand what the Hood had to do
      The Suffolk, the Norfolk, the Cossack as well       Along with the Rodney shelled Bismarck to hell  
      They sank that ship, oh, we're glad; but for our lads we feel sad       So mothers and wives and sweethearts, be proud  
      Though your dear lads have the sea as their shroud       They were fighting for freedom, let's never forget  
      The freedom they fought for will be won yet       They're sleeping in heavenly peace, sleeping in heavenly peace"

125,I Popped Out," I used to be a sailor, I sailed upon  the sea, 
        And when I was at home my wife was  very good to me, 
        But I commenced to worry and to  wonder what she'd do, 
        When I was off a-sailing out upon the  ocean blue  What if I popped out  and I caught her unawares, 
      Popped out sudden  from the cupboard in the stairs, 
      Popped out, popped up   and took her by surprise, 
       Sometimes me boys  it's better to be ignorant than wise
I kissed me wife goodbye and told her I was bound to sail 
         Upon a Yankee whaling ship they  called the Horse's Tail
         I told her I'd return again in six  months or a year
        Then I hid myself beneath the stairs  to see what should appear If I popped out and I caught her  unawares
        Popped out sudden from the  cupboard in the stairs
        Popped out, popped up, popped  aloft to see 
        If my little wife was mis-rable  and lonely without me

        Well, first there came the cabin boy, and then there came the cook
        She had them by appointment in a red  appointment book
        
        The bosun piped himself aboard, and  played a merry tune
last there came the captain with  his bloody great harpoonThen I popped out and I caught them  unawares
        Popped out sudden from the  cupboard in the stairs
        Popped out, popped up, and popped  them out the door
        And I vowed an oath I never would  go sailing any moreNow let this be a warning to all you jolly tars 
        Who leave your wives at home to go  off sailing near and far

        Myself, I'm a greengrocer now, my  flat's above me shop
        And any time I have the chance it's  up the stairs I pop Yes I pop up and I catch her  unawares, 
        I pop her in the parlor and I pop  her on the stairs
        Pop in, pop out, and pop back to  the till
        And you can take your bloody  sailing ships, and 
        pop them where you will"
126,Indian Lass,"As I was a-walkin' upon a fine day
        

        I got awful lonesome as the day passed away
        

        I sat down a-musing, alone on the grass 

        When who should sit by me but a sweet Indian lass. 
    She sat down beside me and took hold of my hand
    
Said, ""You sure be a stranger, and in a strange land."" 
She asked me to marry and gave me her hand, 
Said, ""My pappy's a chieftain all over this land.""

""My pappy's a chieftain, and ruler be he
    

    I'm his only daughter and my name is Mohee"" 

    I answered and told her that it never could be 

    Cause I had my own sweetheart in my own country.

I had my own sweetheart, and I knew she loved me
    
    Her heart was as true as any Mohee 
So I said, ""I must leave you and goodbye my dear
    
There's wind in my canvas and home I must steer.""

    At home with relations I tried for to see
    

    But there wasn't a one like my little Mohee, 

    And the girl I had trusted proved untrue to me 
So I sailed o'er the ocean to my little Mohee

                        In Heaven there are no wars or 
                        Cars, or movie stars
                        And when we no longer are
                        The world will probably still be having wars.

                        What the heck! Yeah!

130,It's Of A Sailor Bold ,"Late 1800's Dorset England 

It's of a sailor bold        
        And lately come on shore
Both brisk and bold        
Well lined with gold 
To his lover he did repair

          In old and ragged dress          
        Unto his love did go
          Unto his love          
        All for to prove
          Whether she'll be kind or no.

          My merchandise I've lost          
        My ship is gone astray
          Which makes me fret          
        I'm deep in debt
          Not a tenth part can I pay 

Come in, my dear sit down          
Put off thy ragged array
          And I will be          
        So kind to thee
          And all thy debts I'll pay

          I've gold in store of my own
          My debts all for to clear          
        I've rings I've ribbons
          I've jewels so bright          
        And gems to trick the hair

          'Twas down in Stockton Church          
          The happy knot was tied.          
        From land to land
          There's no man can          
          Match the sailor and his bride   "
131,Jackaroe,"
          There was a silk merchant in London he did  dwell 

          He had only one daughter and the truth to  you I’ll tellThis young lady she was courted by men of  high degree

        There was none but Jack the sailor would  ever do for sheAs soon as her waiting maid heard what she  did say

          She went to her father and there she did betray


Dear daughter if this be true what I have  heard of you
Jackie shall be vanished and you confined too          Poor Jackie has gone to sea with trouble  on his mind

        A-leaving of his country and darling girl  behindShe went into a tailor shop got dressed in  men’s array
She went onto a vessel to convey herself  away Before you step onboard sir, your name I’d  like to know
She smiled all over her countenance they  call me JackaroeYour waist is light and slender your  fingers neat and small
Your cheeks too red and rosy to face the  cannonball          I know my waist is light and slender, my  fingers are neat and small
But I never change my countenance to face  the cannonball The wars being over she hunted all around
Among the dead and wounded and her darling  boy she foundShe picked him all up in her arms and  carried him back to the town

      And sent for a physician who quickly  healed his woundsThis couple they got married so well they  did agree
This couple they got married and why not  you and me     "
132,Jack The Sailor,"When I first landed in Liverpool I  went upon a spree    Being paid off at last I spent it  fast got drunk as drunk could be And when me money was all gone it was  then I wanted more 
A man must be blind to make up his  mind to go to sea once more Once more, once more, once more, me  lads once more A man must be blind to make up his  mind to go to sea once more

        A Lime Street girl drew up to me and offered me a bed But when I awoke on the next day’s  morn with me watch and me money she’d fled And as I walk the streets about the  whores they all do roar ""There goes young Jack the  sailor lad he must go to sea once more"" Once more, once more, once more, me  lads once more ""There goes young Jack the  sailor lad he must go to sea once more"" 

        As I was walking down the street I met with Jackie Brown I asked him if he’d take me in, he  eyed me with a frown He said, ""Last time you  was paid off with me you ran up a score But I’ll take a chance and I’ll  give an advance and I’ll send you to sea once more"" Once more, once more, once more, me  lads once more But I’ll take a chance and I’ll  give an advance and I’ll send you to sea once more""


        He shipped me aboard a whaling ship that was bound for Arctic seas Where the cold winds blow and the  frost and snow would make your rum ration freeze And worse to say I’ve no hard  weather gear for I’ve lost all me money ashore My God, how I wish that I was dead  and I’d go to sea no more No more, no more, no more, me lads no  more My God, how I wish that I was dead  and I’d go to sea no more

        Sometimes we’re catching whales, me lads and sometimes we’re catching none With a twenty foot oar stuck in your  hand from four o’clock in the morn And when the shades of night come on  you rest your weary oar Tis then that you wish that you were  dead or safe with the girls ashore Ashore, ashore, ashore me lads ashore It's then that you wish that you were  dead or safe with the girls ashore

        So come all you bold seafaring lads and listen to me song When you come off those long, long  trips I pray you’ll never go wrong Take my advice, drink no strong wine  and take up with no whore Get married instead, have all night  in bed and go to sea no more No more, no more, no more, me lads no  more Get married instead, have all night  in bed and go to sea no more"
133,John Dory,"As it fell on a holy day, And upon a holy tide, a,  

        John Dory bought him an ambling nag To Paris for to ride, a. And when John Dory to Paris was come A little before the gate, a, John Dory was fitted, the porter was witted To let him in thereat, a. The first man that John Dory did meet Was good King John of France, a. John Dory could well of his courtesy, But fell down in a trance, a.  A pardon, a pardon, my liege and my king, For my merry men and for me, a, And all the churls in merry England I'll bring them all bound to thee, a. And Nicholl was then a Cornish man, A little beside Bohyde, a, And he manned forth a good black bark With fifty good oars on a side, a. Run up, my boy, unto the maintop, And look what thou canst spy, a. Who ho, who ho, a goodly ship I do see; I'd row it to be John Dory, a. They hoist their sails both top and top, The mizzen and all was tried, a; And every man stood to his lot, Whatever should betide, a. The roaring cannons then were plied, And dub a dub went the drum, a; The braying trumpets loud they cried To courage both all and some, a. The grappling hooks were brought at length, The brown bill and the sword, a; John Dory at length, for all his strength, Was clapped fast under board, a"

136,The Landlady of France,"A landlady of France loved an officer, 'tis said

        And the officer he dearly loved his brandy-o.

        Now said she ""I dearly love this officer, tho' his nose is red

        And his legs are what the regiment calls bandy-o.        
        

But when this bandy officer was ordered to the  coast,

        Then she tore her lovely locks that looked so sandy-o

        ""Now goodbye, my love,"" said she, ""when you write please pay the  post,

      But before we part we'll take a drop of brandy-o."" 

""Take a bottle of it with you,"" to  the officer she said,

  ""In your tent, you know, my love will be the dandy-o""

  ""You're right, my dear,"" said he, ""for a tent is very damp

      And 'tis better in my tent to take some brandy-o"" 

So she filled him up a bumper just before he  left the town,

        With another for herself so neat and handy-o.

        And to keep their droopin' spirits up the poured the spirits down,

        For love is like the colic, cured with brandy-o    "
137,The Lass of Swansea Town,"It was down by Swansea barracks  one May morning I strayed
          A-viewing of the soldier lads  I spied a comely maid
          It was o'er her red and rosy cheeks  the tears did dingle down
          I thought she was some goddess fair  the lass of Swansea town

          I said  Fair maid, what brought you here  what brought you here to mourn
          Oh I'm in search of Willie dear  my bonny young sailor boy
          Eight years ago he left me here  for Bermuda he was bound
          He said he would prove faithful to  the lass of Swansea town

          If eight years ago he left you  it is useless for to mourn
          For perhaps he is in some battle slain  or in the ocean drowned
          Oh God forbid young man she said  by what token will he be known
          If he ever do return to the  lass of Swansea Town

          On his left breast he wears a scar  where he received a wound
          If by that token your Willie is known  it's him I know right well
          The cannon-ball which made him fall  gave him his deathly wound 
          He told me to take care of you  the lass of Swansea town

          Soon as she heard him say these words  she fell in deep despair 
          Wringing of her lily-white hands  and tearing of her hair
          Saying  Take me to my Willie  else give me my death wound
          For no other man will ever enjoy  the lass of Swansea town

          On coming to herself once more up  from the ground she rose
          His waistcoat it blew open and  the scar it did expose
          They walked till they reached his cottage  and there they settled down
          Young Willie of the royal blue and  the lass of Swansea town "

So fare thee well, my own true love

It’s me second trip with Burgess on the  Crockett, and

146,The Low Low Lands of Holland,"The very day I was married
          That night I lay on my bed
          A press gang came to my bedside
          These words to me they said
          Arise arise arise young man
          And come along with me with me
          To the low low lands of Holland
          To face your enemy

          But Holland is a cold place
          A place where grows no green
          And Holland is a cold place
          For my love to wander in
          Though money had been as plentiful
          As leaves upon the tree the tree
          Yet before I'd time to turn myself
          My love was stolen from me

          I'll build my love a gallant ship
          A ship of noted fame.
          With four and twenty seamen bold
          To box her on the main
          They'll rant and roar in sparkling glee
          Where some ever they do go do go
          To the low low lands of Holland
          To face the daring foe

          Says the mother to the daughter
          What makes you to lament
          O there are lords and dukes and squires
          Can ease your heart's content
          But never will I married be
          Until the day I die I die
          since the low, low lands of Holland
          Have parted my love and me

          There's not a swathe goes round my waist
          Nor comb goes in my hair
          Neither firelight nor candle light
          Can ease my heart's despair
          And never will I married be
          Until the day I die I die
          Since the low low lands of Holland
          Have parted my love and me "
147,Lowlands,"I dreamed my love came in my sleep

Lowlands - Lowlands away my John.

          I shall never kiss you again he said 

        Lowlands - Lowlands away my John. 
          For I am drowned in the Lowland seas

      My Lowlands away 
          No other man shall think me fair

149,Maggie May,"Now gather round you sailor boys and  listen to my plea and 
When you’ve heard my tale you’ll pity  me

       For I was a real damned fool in the port  of Liverpool
The first time that I came home from the  sea……………..
          We paid off at the home from the port of Sierra Leone and
Four pounds ten a month that was my pay
With a pocket full of tin I was very soon  taken in by a
Girl with the name of Maggie May.

CHORUS
Oh Maggie Maggie May they have taken her away
And she’ll never walk down Lime street  anymore
For she robbed so many sailors and  captains of the whalers
That  dirty robbin’ no good Maggie May.



          Oh well I do remember when I first met Maggie May
She was cruising up and down old Canning  Place
She’d a figure so divine  like a  frigate of the line
So me being a sailor  I gave chase………..…CHORUS


          Next morning when I awoke I was flat and stoney broke
No jacket  trousers waistcoat I could  find
When I asked her where they were she said  - My very dear sir
They’re down in Kelly’s knocker  number nine...CHORUS

          To the pawnshop I did go but no clothes there I did find and
The policeman came and took that girl  away
The judge he guilty found her of 
          
        Robbing  the homeward  bounder and
Paid her passage back to Botany Bay ...

151,Married To A Mermaid,"There was a gay young farmer,
          Who liv'd on Salisbury plain;
          He lov'd a rich Knight's daughter dear!
          And she lov'd him again.
          The Knight he was distressed,
          That they should sweethearts be.
          So he had the farmer soon pressed,
          And sent him off to sea.
          Singing Rule Britannia,
          Britannia rules the waves
          Britons never, never, never shall be slaves...

          'Twas on the deep Atlantic,
          Midst Equinoctial gales;
          This young farmer fell overboard
          Among the sharks and whales;
          He disappeared so quickly,
          So headlong down went he,
          That he went out of sight
          Like a streak of light
          To the bottom of the deep blue sea.
          Singing Rule Britannia,
          Britannia rules the waves
          Britons never, never, never shall be slaves...

          We lowered a boat to find him,
          We thought to see his corse,
          When up to the top he came with a bang,
          And sang in a voice so hoarse,
          'My comrades and my messmates,
          Oh, do not weep for me,
          For I'm married to a mermaid,
          At the bottom of the deep blue sea.'
          Singing Rule Britannia,
          Britannia rules the waves
          Britons never, never, never shall be slaves...

          He said that as he went down,
          Great fishes he did see;
          They seemed to think as he did wink,
          That he was rather free.
          But down he went so quickly,
          Saying, ''Tis all up with me,'
          When he met a lovely mermaid
          At the bottom of the deep blue sea.
          Singing Rule Britannia,
          Britannia rules the waves
          Britons never, never, never shall be slaves...

          She came at once unto him,
          And gave him her white hand,
          Saying, 'I have waited long, my dear,
          To welcome you to land.
          Go to your ship and tell them,
          You'll leave them all for me;
          For you're married to a mermaid
          At the bottom of the deep blue sea.'
          Singing Rule Britannia,
          Britannia rules the waves
          Britons never, never, never shall be slaves...

          The wind was fair, the sails set,
          The ship was running free;
          When we all went to the captain bold,
          And told what we did see.
          He went unto the ship's side,
          And loudly bellowed he,
          'Be happy as you can, my man,
          At the bottom of the deep blue sea.'
          Singing Rule Britannia,
          Britannia rules the waves
          Britons never, never, never shall be slaves."

153,My Boy Willie," It was early early all in the Spring  That my boy Willie went to serve the King  The night was dark and the wind blew high  It was then I lost my dear sailor boy      The night is long and I can find no rest  The thought of Willie runs in my breast I'll search the green woods and village wide  Still hoping my true love to find.      Oh father father give me a boat  Out on the ocean that I may float  To watch the big boats as they pass by  That I might enquire for my sailor boy    She was not long out upon the deep  When a man-o-war vessel she chanced to meet  Saying Captain captain now tell me true  If my boy Willie is on board with you    What sort of boy is your Willie dear  Or what sort of a suit does your Willie wear  He wears a suit of the royal blue  And you'll easy know him for his heart is true    Oh, then your boy Willie I am sorry to say  Has just been drowned the other day  On yon green island that we pass by  'Twas there we laid your poor sailor boy    She wrung her hands and she tore her hair  And she sobbed and sighed in her despair  And with every sob she let fall a tear  And every sigh was for her Willie dear Oh father, make my grave both wide and deep  With a fine tombstone at my head and feet  And in the middle a turtle dove That the world may know that I died of love    Come all you sailors who sail along  And all you boatmen who follow on. From the cabin-boy to the mainmast high  Ye must mourn in black for my sailor boy"

          We cherish still the Norfolk girls and the Portsmouth maidens tooMay the cheek whereon reposes emotion young  and dear
          Still wear the hue of roses thro' each succeeding year
          We'll drink to by past scenes and hope some day again to view
          The lovely girls of Norfolk and the Portsmouth maidens tooAnd if we never backward go borne home on  ocean's breast
          But find among the caves below a sailor's place of rest
          Still ere we close our eyes and pass beneath the depths of blue
          We'll think of all the Norfolk girls and Portsmouth maidens tooShould the foe appear before us to our guns  we'll fondly cling
          While our stars are gleaming o'er us shall their notes of freedom ring
          While life's warm stream is flowing our eager pulses through 
          We'll fight for home the Norfolk girls And Portsmouth maidens tooFill up fill up yet once again before we say  goodnight
          From every glass its sweetness drain to friendship's steady light
          May peace around our kindred dwell all beings loved and true
          The lovely girls of Norfolk and the Portsmouth maidens tooGood night good night our pillows now with  pleasant thoughts we'll press 
          And dream some hand rests on our brow its slumbering to bless
          Amid delightful reveries that fancy brings to view
          Perhaps we'll meet the Norfolk girls and Portsmouth maidens too"
158,O Columbia The Gem Of The Ocean ,"Oh Columbia! the gem of the ocean,
          The home of the brave and the free,
          The shrine of each patriot's devotion,
          A world offers homage to thee.

          Thy mandates make heroes assemble
          When Liberty's form stands in view;
          Thy banners make tyranny tremble
          When borne by the Red, White and Blue, 
          When borne by the Red, White and Blue,
          When borne by the Red, White and Blue,
          Thy banners make tyranny tremble
          When borne by the red, white and blue.


          When war winged its wide desolation,
          And threatened the land to deform,
          The ark then of freedom's foundation,
          Columbia, rode safe through the storm:

          With her garlands of vict'ry around her,
          When so proudly she bore her brave crew,
          With her flag proudly floating before her,
          The boast of the Red, White and Blue, 
          The boast of the Red, White and Blue,
          The boast of the Red, White and Blue,
          With her flag proudly floating before her,
      The boast of the Red, White and Blue.The Union, the Union forever,
          Our glorious nation's sweet hymn,
          May the wreaths it has won never wither,
          Nor the stars of its glory grow dim,

          The wine cup, the wine cup bring hither,
          And fill you it true to the brim!
          May the wreaths they have won never wither,
          Nor the star of their glory grow dim!

          The star-spangled banner bring hither,
          O'er Columbia's true sons let it wave;
          May the wreaths they have won never wither,
          Nor its stars cease to shine on the brace:

          Old Glory to greet, now come hither,
          With eyes full of love to the brim,
          May the wreaths of the heroes ne'er wither,
          Nor a star of our banner grow dim,

          May the service, united, ne'er sever,
          But they to their colours prove true;
          The Army and Navy forever,
          Three cheers for the Red, White and Blue, 
          Three cheers for the Red, White and Blue, 
          Three cheers for the Red, White and Blue,

161,One Of The Roaming Kind ,"As I went out one evening upon a night's career

        I spied a lofty clipper ship and to her I did steer
I hoisted out my signals which she so quickly knew
For when she saw my bunting fly she quickly hove to
        
        CHORUS after each verse:

        She had a dark and a roving eye and her  hair fell down in ringlets 

        She  was a nice girl, a popular girl but one of the roaming kind


          2
          I took her for some fish and chips and treated her so fine 
And hardly did I realize she was the roaming kind 
I kissed her lips  I missed her lips and found to my surprise 
She was nothing but a pirate ship rigged out dressed up in disguise  3
        Now come all ye good sailor men who sail the wintry sea 
And come all ye apprentice lads fair warning take from me 
Beware of lofty clipper ships they'll be the ruin of you 
For 'twas then she made me walk the plank and pushed me under too."

        And bird singing gaily among the trees.

        High ho for the ox-eyed man.


        Oh, May looked up and she saw her fate

        In the ox-eyed man passing by the gate

        High ho for the ox-eyed man.


        The ox-eyed man gave a fond look of love,
And charmed May's heart which was pure as a dove,

        High ho for the ox-eyed man.

Oh, May in the parlor a sitting on his knee,
And kissing the sailor who'd come o'er the sea
High ho for the ox-eyed man.

Now weeps for the sailor who sailed over the sea.

        'Bout ship and stations and be  handy

          Rise tacks and sheets and mainsails  haul

          There was a Yankee ship laying in the basin

          And they told me she was going to New York ...  CHORUS

          I'll murder him if it's the last thing I  do....CHORUS

          When the pilot left the  ship way down the channel

           Oh the captain told us we were going 'round  Cape Horn ...CHORUS
 The mate and the second mate belong in Boston

          And the captain hailed from Bangor down in  Maine...CHORUS

          The three of them were rough and tumble fighters

          When not fighting amongst themselves they turned on us...CHORUS

          They called us out one night to reef the  topsails

          Not a man in the bunch could sing a song... CHORUS
 We are tinkers we are  tailors and the fireman  also cooks
And they couldn't sing a  shanty unless they had  the books... CHORUS
  Wasn't that a bunch of  hoodlums
For to take a ship 'round Cape Horn...CHORUS "
166,Paddy West,"As I was walking down London Street I come to  Paddy West's house
      He gave me a dish of American hash he called it Liverpool scouse
      He said There's a ship and she's wanting hands and on her you must sign
      The mate's a bastard the captain's worse but she will suit you fine

      CHORUS
      Take off your dungaree jacket and give yourself a rest
      And we'll think on them cold nor'westers that we had at Paddy West's.

      When we had finished our dinner boys the wind began to blow
      Paddy sent me to the attic the main-royal for to stow
      But when I got to the attic no main-royal could I find
      So I turned myself 'round to the window and I furled the window blind   

      CHORUS

      Now Paddy he pipes all hands on deck their stations for to man
      His wife she stood in the doorway a bucket in her hand
      And Paddy he cries Now let her rip and she throws the water our way
      Crying Clew in the fore the gan'sl boys she's taking on the spray  

CHORUS

      Now seeing she's bound for the southward to Frisco she was bound
      Paddy he takes a length of rope and he lays it on the ground
      We all steps over and back again and he says to me That's fine
      And if ever they ask were you ever at sea you can say you crossed the line 

CHORUS

      To every two men that graduates I'll give one outfit free
      For two good men on watch at once ye never need to see
      Oilskins me boys you'll never want carpet slippers made of felt
      I'll dish out to the pair o' you and a rope yarn for a belt  

      CHORUS

      Paddy says Now pay attention these lessons you will learn
      The starboard is where the ship she points the right is called the stern
      So look ye aft to your starboard port and you will find northwest
      And that's the way they teach you at the school of Paddy West 

CHORUS

      There's just one thing for you to do before you sail away
      Just step around the table where the bullock's horn do lay Ten
      And if ever they ask Were you ever at sea  you can say Ten times  'round the Horn
      And be jaisus but you're and old sailor man from the day that you were born   

      CHORUS

      Put on your dungaree jacket and walk out looking your best
      And tell 'em that you're an old sailor man that's come from Paddy West's"

169,The Pirate Song,"My boat's by the tower, and my bark's on the  bay, 
        And both must be gone at the dawn of the day.
        The moon's in her shroud, and to light thee afar 
        On the deck of the daring's a  lovelighted star.
        So  wake, lady wake, I am waiting for thee, 
        Oh, this night or never my bride thou  shalt be,
        So wake, lady wake, I am waiting for  thee,

        So forgive me my rough mood unaccustomed to sue 
        I woo not, perhaps, as your  landlubbers do.
        My voice is attuned to the sound of the gun 
        That startles the deep when the  combat's begun.

        So wake, lady wake, I am waiting for  thee,

170,Pleasant And Delightful,"'Twas pleasant and delightful one midsummer's morn
To view the fine meadows all covered with corn 
And the blackbirds and thrushes sang on every green spray 

          And the larks they sang melodious at the dawning of the day 

          And the larks they sang melodious and the larks they sang melodious 
And the larks they sang melodious at the dawning of the day. 
A sailor and his true love were walking one day 
Said the sailor to his true love 

          I'm bound far away 
I’m bound for the Indies where load cannons do roar 

          I must go and leave you Nancy you're the girl I adore 
I must go and leave you Nancy I must go and leave you Nancy 
I must go and leave you Nancy you're the girl that I adore 

The ring from off her finger she instantly drew 

          Saying  Take this dearest Willie and me heart will go too 

        And as she embraced her tears from her eyes fell 

        Saying  May I go along with you 
Oh no me love farewell 
Saying  May I go along with you - saying 
May I go along with you 
Saying May I go along with you 
Oh no me love farewell 
So fare thee well my dearest Nancy 
I'm bound far away 

          The ship is a-waiting out there in the bay 

          The anchor is hoisted she waits the next flowing tide 
And if ever I return again 
I will make you my bride 
And if ever I return again and if ever I return again 
And if ever I return again I will make you my bride "
171,Poor Joe The Marine,"Poor Joe the marine was at Portsmouth well known  No lad in the corps dressed so smart  The lasses never looked at the lad with a frown  His manliness won every heart  

Sweet Polly at Portsmouth he took for his bride  And surely there never was seen  A couple so gay march to church, side by side  As Polly and Joe the marine    

The bright torch of Hymen was scarce in a blaze  When thundering drums they heard rattle  And Joe in an instant was forced to the seas  To give a bold enemy battle  

The action was dreadful each ship a mere wreck  Such slaughter few sailors have seen  Two hundred brave fellows lay strewed on the deck  And among them poor Joe the marine    

But victory faithful to brave British tars  At length put an end to the fight  Then homeward they steered full of glory and scars And soon had famed Portsmouth in sight  

The ramparts were crowded the heroes to greet And foremost sweet Polly was seen  But the very first sailor she chanced for to meet  Told the fate of poor Joe the marine

172,Poor Old Horse,"When I was young and in my prime
          And in my stable lay
          They gave to me the very best corn...
          And the choicest hay
          Poor old horse          Poor old mare


          My master used to ride me out
          And tie me to the stile
          And he was courting the miller's girl
          While I could trot a mile
          Poor old horse          Poor old mare


          Now I am old and done for
          And fit for nothing at all
          I'm forced to eat the sour grass
          That grows along the wall
          Poor old horse          Poor old mare


          Then lay my tottering legs so low
          That have run very far
          O'er hedges and o'er ditches
          O'er turnpike gate and bar
          Poor old horse          Poor old mare


          My hide I'll give to the huntsman
          My shoes I'll throw away
          The dogs shall eat my rotten flesh
          And that's how I'll decay

          A few months being over and a few months being pastThis fair she began to grow sick at  the last She grew sick at the last and she  couldn't tell for why And she sent for the sailor that she  of-times did deny
          Am I the doctor that you sent for meOr am I the young man that you sent  for meOh yes you're the doctor you can  either kill or cureThe pain that I feel dear is hard to  endure
          Where does the pain lie does it lie in your head Or where does the pain lie does it  lie in your sideOh indeed young man you're not far  off the guess The pain that I feel lies under my  left breast
          She took the gold rings off her fingers by one two or three SayingTake you these dear Willie in  remembrance of meIn remembrance of me my dear when I  am dead and gone And perhaps you'll be sorry then for  what you have done
Oh Sally dearest Sally oh Sally dear  said he Don't you remember when you first  slighted me You mocked me with cruelty and  slighted me with scorn And now I'll reward you for what you  have done.
          Oh Willie dearest Willie forget and forgive And grant me a little while longer to  liveOh no dearest Sally as long as I  breathe I'll dance on your tomb while you lie  underneath

177,Ratcliffe Highway,"As I was a-walking down Wapping I stepped into Ratcliffe HighwayAnd there I went into an alehouse To spend all that night and next day
          Two charming young girls sat beside meThey asked if I'd money to sportBring a bottle of wine change a guineaI see you are one of the sort
          The bottle was placed on the table With glasses for every oneWhen I asked for the change of my guinea She gave me the verse of a song
          The old woman she flew in a passionAnd placed her two hands on her hip Saying - Young man you don't know our fashionYou think you're on board of your ship
          If that is your fashion to rob me It's a fashion I don't much admireSo tip me the change of my guineaOr a broadside into you I'll fire
          The bottle that stood on the table I quick at her head did let flyAnd down on the ground she did tumble And loudly for mercy did cry
          The gold watch that hung on the mantelI into my pocket did slipAnd darn my old shoes didn't I trick herAnd soon got aboard of my ship
          Our anchor being weighed at our bow boysOur tops'ls being well sheeted homeWe soon bid adieu to fair LondonAnd all the flash girls in the town"

180,Roast Beef Of Old England,"Written by John Gay in 1735 about the pleasures of the roast beef in old England  and the praises shed upon itWhen mighty roast beef was the Englishmen's food  
        It ennobled our hearts and enriched our  blood
        Our soldiers were brave and our courtiers were  good
Oh!  The roast beef of old  England!  
        For old England's roast beef La la   -  la  la   la  la la -  la  la  la  la la  -   la   la

        Oh!  The roast beef of old  England!  

        For old England's roast beef 
        Our fathers of old were robust and stout
        And kept open house with good cheer all day  long
        Which made their plump tenants rejoice in this  song
Oh!  The roast beef of old  England!  
        For old England's roast beef La la   -  la  la   la  lala -  la  la  la  la la  -   la   la   la   la la

        Oh!  The roast beef of old  England!  

        For old England's roast beef 
        In those days if fleets did presume on the main
        They seldom or never returned back again
        As witness the vaunting armada of Spain...
Oh!  The roast beef of old  England!  
        For old England's roast beef La la   -  la  la   la  lala -  la  la  la  la la  -   la   la   la   la la

189,Sailing Sailing ,"Ya heave ho my lads 
          
          The wind blows  free

          A pleasant gale 
        Is on our lee
          And soon across 
          The ocean clear 

          Our gallant barque 
        Shall bravely  steer

But ere we part from 
          Freedom's shore  tonight

          A song we'll sing from 
        Home and  beauty bright
          Then here's to the sailor
        And here's to the soldier too 
Hearts will beat for him 
        Upon the waters blue

          Sailing, sailing, 
          Over the bounding  Main
For many a stormy wind shall blow 

          Ere Jack comes home again 

Sailing sailing 
          Over the bounding  Main
For many a stormy wind shall blow 
Ere Jack comes home again"

Sweetest girl in all the valley...

Seven long years and she wouldn't marry...
And I no longer cared to tarry...

For her I sail upon the water...

Her eyes are blue her hair is curly...
        Now my troubles now are over...
Sally's married to a dirty soldier...   "

195,The Saucy Arethusa,"Come all ye jolly sailors bold        Whose hearts are cast in honour's mould
          While English glory I unfold          Hurrah for the Arethusa

          She is a frigate tight and brave 
          As ever stemmed the dashing wave
          Her men are staunch to their favorite launch
          And when the foe shall meet our fire          Sooner than strike we'll all expire
          On board of the Arethusa

          'Twas with the spring fleet she went out 
          The English Channel to cruise about
          When four French sail in show so stout          Bore down on the Arethusa

          The famed Belle Poole straight a head did lie 
          The Arethusa seemed to fly
          Not a sheet or a tack or a brace did she slack          
        Though the Frenchmen laughed and thought it stuff
          But they knew not the handful of men how tough
          On board of the Arethusa.

          On deck five hundred men did dance          The stoutest they could find in France
          We with two hundred did advance          On board of the Arethusa.

          Our captain hailed the Frenchman Ho 
          The Frenchmen then cried out Hallo
          Bear down d'ya see to our Admiral's lee          No no says the Frenchman that can't be
          Then I must lug you along with me          Says the saucy Arethusa.

          The fight was off the Frenchman's land          We forced them back upon their strand
          For we fought till not a stick would stand 
          Of the gallant Arethusa

          And now we've driven the foe ashore          Never to fight with Britons more
          Let each fill a glass to his favorite lass          A health to the captain and officers true
          And all that belong to the jovial crew          On board of the Arethusa      "
196,The Saucy Sailor Boy ,"He was a saucy sailor boy who'd come from afar
      To ask a maid to be the bride of a poor Jack tar

      The maiden a poor fisher girl
stood close by his side
      With scornful look she answered
thus I'll not be your bride

      You're mad to think I'd marry you 
      too ragged you are
      Be gone you saucy sailor boy
be gone you Jack tar

      I've money in my pocket love and
bright gold in store
      These clothes of mine are all in rags 
      but coin can buy more

      Though black my hands my 
      gold is clean so I'll sail afar
      A fairer maid than you I ween 
      will wed this Jack tar

      Stay Stay you saucy sailor boy do not sail afar
      I love you and will marry you you silly Jack tar

      'Twas but to tease I answered so
I thought you could guess
      That when a maiden answers no
she always means yes

      Be gone you pretty fisher girl too artful are you
      So spoke the saucy sailor boy 
	 gone was her Jack tar "

198,The Sheffield Apprentice ,"I was brought up in Sheffield          But not of high degree
          My parents doted on me,          They had no child but me
          I roamed about for pleasure          Where'er my fancy led
          Till I was bound apprentice          Then all my joys were fled

          I did not like my master          He did not use me well
          I made a resolution          Not long with him to dwell
          A wealthy rich young lady          From London met me there
          And offered me great wages          To serve her for a year

          I had not been in London          Scarce one month two or three
          Before my honoured mistress 
          Grew very fond of me
          She said I've gold I've silver          I've houses and I've land
          If you will marry me          They shall be at your command

          0 no dear honoured mistress          I cannot wed you now
          For I have lately promised          Likewise a solemn vow
          To wed with dearest Polly          Your handsome chambermaid
          Excuse me honoured mistress          She has my heart betrayed

          She flew into a passion          And turned away from me
          Resolved within herself          She would be revenged on me
          Her gold ring from her finger          As she was passing by
          She slipped it in my pocket          And for it I must die

          For that before the justice          The justice I was brought
          And there before the justice          I answered for my fault
          Long time I pleaded innocent          But that was all in vain
          She swore so false against me          That I was sent to gaol

          On the day of execution          All on that fatal day
          I prayed the people round me          0 pray come pity me
          Don't laugh at my downfall          For I bid this world adieu
          Farewell my dearest Polly          I died for love of you "

201,Shoals of Herring,"With our nets and gear we’re faringOver the wild and wasteful ocean It’s there on the deep that we harvest and   reap our bread As we hunt the bonny shoals of   herring
          It was on a fine and a pleasant day Out of Yarmouth harbour I was faring As a cabin boy on a sailing lugger For to go and hunt the shoals of   herring
          Now the work was hard and the hours were   long And the treatment sure it took some bearing Her was little kindness and the kicks were   many As we hunted for the shoals of   herring
          Oh we fished the Swarth and the Dogger   Bank I was cook and I’d a quarter-sharing And I used to sleep standing on me feet And I’d dream about the shoals of   herring
          Oh! We left the home grounds in the month   of June And for canny Shiels we soon were bearing With a hundred cran of the silver darling That we’d taken from the shoals of   herring
          Now you’re up on deck you’re a fisherman You can swear and show a manly bearing Take your turn on watch with the other   fellows While you’re searching for shoals of   herring
          In the stormy seas and the living gale Just to earn your daily bread you’re daring From the Dover Straits to the Faeroe Islands As you’re following the shoals of   herring
          Oh I earned my keep and I paid me way And I earned the gear that I was wearing Sailed a million miles, caught ten million   fishes We were sailing after shoals of   herring"

203,Sir Richard Grenvilles Farewell,"Who seeks the way   to win renown, or flies with wings of his desire

          Who seeks to wear the   laureate crown, or hath the mind that would aspire:

          Let him his native soil   eschew, let him go range and seek anew.


          Each haughty heart is well   content with every chance that shall betide;

          No hap can hinder his intent he   steadfast stands, though fortune slide.

          The sun, quoth he, doth shine as well   abroad as erst where I did dwell.


          In change of streams each fish can live   each fowl content with every air;

          Each haughty heart remaineth still and not   be drowned in deep despair:
Wherefore I judge all lands alike to haughty   hearts who fortune seek.


          To pass the seas some think a toil some think it   strange abroad to roam;
Some think it a grief to leave their soil their   parents, kinfolks, and their home.
Think so who list, I like it not I must   abroad to try my lot.


          Who lists at home at cart to drudge and cark and   care for worldly trash,
With buckled shoes let him go trudge instead of lance   or whip to slash:
A mind that base his kind will show of carrion sweet to   feed a crow.

If Jason of that mind had been the Grecians when they came   to Troy
Had never so the Trojans foiled nor never put them to such   annoy:
Wherefore who lust may live at home to purchase fame I will go   roam."

        Thunder clouds rend the air
        Baffled our foe's stand on the   shore
        Follow they will not dareThough the waves leap soft shall ye   sleep
        Ocean's a royal bed

          He come up on the deck and yells all hands make sail Next comes the eels with their nimble   tails
          They jumped up aloft and loosed all the sailsNext come the herrings with their little   tails 
          The manned sheets and halyards and set all the sailsNext comes the porpoise with his short   snout
          He jumps on the bridge and yells ready aboutNext comes the swordfish the scourge of the   sea
          The order he gives is Helm's a leeThen comes the turbot as red as a beet
          He   shouts from the bridge stick out that foresheetHaving accomplished these wonderful   feats
          The blackfish sings out next to rise tacks and sheetNext comes the whale the largest of   all
          Singing out from the bridge haul taut mainsail haulThen comes the mackerel with his striped   back
          He flopped on the bridge and yelled board the main tack

          Next   comes the sprat the smallest of all
          He sings out: haul well taut let go and   haulThen comes the catfish with his chuckle   head
          Out in the main chains for a heave of the leadNext comes the flounder quite fresh from the   ground
          Crying damn your eyes chucklehead mind where you soundAlong came a dolphin flapping his tail
          He   yelled to the boatswain to reef the foresailAlong came the shark with his three rows of   teeth
          He flops on the foreyard and takes a snug reefUp jumps the fisherman stalwart and   grim
          And with his big net he scooped them all in"
207,South Australia,"  Capstan shanty  In South Australia I was born  To me heave away, haul away In South Australia round Cape Horn CHORUS after each verse: We're bound for South Australia haul away you rolling kings To me heave away, haul away haul away, you'll hear me sing We're bound for South Australia As I walked out one morning fair To me heave away, haul away 'Twas there I met Miss Nancy Blair I shook her up and I shook her down To me heave away, haul away I shook her round and round the town  

        I run her all night and I run her all day To me heave away, haul away And I run her until we sailed away There ain't but one thing grieves me mind   To me heave away, haul away To leave Miss Nancy Blair behind  And as we wallop around Cape Horn  To me heave away, haul away You'll wish to God you'd never been born    In South Australia my native land To me heave away, haul away  Full of rocks and thieves and fleas and sand I wish I was on Australia's strand  To me heave away, haul away With a bottle of whiskey in my hand"

        Farewell and adieu to you ladies of   Spain

        For we’ve received orders to sail to   New Bedford
        Nantucket to the Vinyard is just a few   leagues
 CHORUS
          We’ll rant and we’ll roar like true   Yankee sailors

          We’ll rant and we’ll rave across the   salt sea

          Till we strike soundings in the harbor   of New Bedford

          1 Nantucket to home is just   a few leagues

          2 Great Point to home is just a few   leagues

          3 the Vinyard to home is just a few   leagues

          4 Woods Hole to home is just a few   leagues

          5 West Island to home is just a few   leagues

We hove our ship to   with the wind at the sou’west boys
          We hove our ship to for to take   soundings clear

          In fifty five fathoms with a fine sandy   bottom
          We filled main tops’l up channel did   steer 

          CHORUS          The first land we made was a place   called Nantucket
        Martha’s Vinyard Woods Hole then down   Buzzards Bay

        We sailed then by Marion Mattapoisett   and Fairhaven
        Then bore straight away for New Bedford   hooray…..

        CHORUS          Now the Captain called out for our   grand ship to anchor
        We clewed up our tops’ls stuck out   tacks and sheets

        We stood by our stoppers, we brailed in   our spankers
        And anchored ahead of the noblest of   fleets…..

        CHORUS

        Let every man here drink up his full   bumper
        Let every man here drink up his full   bowl

        And drink a health to each jovial and   true hearted soul…..

        CHORUS "
209,Stand To Your Guns,"Stand to your guns my hearts of oak 

        let   not a word on board be spokeVictory soon will crown the joke 

        be   silent and be readyRam home your guns and sponge them 

        well   let us be sure the balls will tellThe cannon's roar shall sound their   knell

be steady, boys be steadyNot yet, nor yet, nor yet reserve your   fire  - 

I do desire "" fire""
Now the elements do rattle the Gods

amazed behold the battle A broadside my boys see 

        the blood in   purple tideTrickle down her battered side 

        winged   with fate the bullets flyConquer boys or bravely die 

        hurl   destruction on your foesShe sinks Huzza! to the bottom 

        to the   bottom down she goes"
210,Stately Southerner,"'Tis of a stately Southerner 
          
          Who   flew the Stripes and Stars 
          The whistling wind from west nor'west 
Blew   through our pitch-pine spars 
          We had our larboard tacks on board 
          As we   hung upon a gale
          Gable Island light shone bright 
          From the Old Head of   Kinsale

          No thought was there of shortening sail 
          By him who trod our   poop
          Although the press of our pondering jibs
          The boom bends like a   hoop
          Our groaning chess-trees told the strain 
          That stood on our stout   main tack 
          But he only laughed as he glanced abaft 
          At the white and   glistening trackIt was a bright and a cloudless   night
          The wind blew fresh and strong 
          As gaily o'er the Channel wave 
          Our good ship swept along
          With the foaming sea before her bow 
          The   briny wave she spread 
          Till bending low in a foam like snow 
          She buries   her lee catheadWhat's this upon our weather bow 
          What ship is this I see
          It's time our good ship hauled her wind
          We're   abreast the old Saltee
          'Twas by the nightly robe she wore 
          And her   tapering length of spar 
          We knew our morning visitor 
          Was a British   man-o'-warWhat did our daring foeman do
          A shot   ahead he passed
          Clewed up his flowing courses
          Laid his topsails to the   mast
          Those British tars gave three huzzas 
          From the deck of their black   corvette 
          But we answered back with a scornful laugh 
          As our starry flag   we setOut booms, out booms cried the   Southerner
          Out booms and give her sheet
          Here comes the fastest man-o'-war 
          Of all the Channel fleet
          She's bearing down upon us boys
          With the   white foam at her bow Out booms out booms cried the   Southerner
          Don't spare your canvas nowThe mid tide meets the Channel wave 
          That flows from shore to shore 
          The mist hung heavy over the land 
          From Featherstone to Dunmore
          The day star glinted in the east
          Four   bells had rolled the hour
          And the sterling light on Tuskar Rock
          Was   quenched in the Waterford TowerOut spoke our noble captain then
          Not   a cloud was on his brow
          Stand by my gallant heroes all
          The enemy's on us   now
          We carry aloft the Stars and Stripes 
          Against old England's   boast
          Paul Jones the terror of the sea
          Will fly them on her   coastThe fog was rising over the land
          The   wind was from the shore
          And the poor Dungarven fishernen 
          Sought shelter   in Kinsore
          With light sails set and booms rigged out 
          And stun's'ls   hoisted away 
          Paul Jones did clear the Channel mouth 
          Before the dawn of   day"
211,Stormy Weather Boys,"We're laying in Surrey Dock one   day

        When the mate told us to get under wayCHORUS after each   verse:
        
        Stormy weather boys stormy weather   boys

        When the wind   blows our barge will go


        He's homeward bound but he's out of   luck

      Cause the skipper's half drunk in the Dog and Duck
        Then the skipper came aboard with a   girl on his arm

        He's going to give up barging and take a farm
        So the mate ran forward and the cook   fell in the dock

        And the skipper caught his knickers in the mainsheet   block
        We shored her off and away did   go

        But the skipper's got a bottle of beer below
        She fills away and she sails like heck 

        But there ain't no bargemen up on deck
        Then up comes a mermaid covered in   mud

        So we took her down in the fo'csle and had a good time"
212,Strike The Bell ,"Up on the poop deck and walking about
        There is the second mate so steady and so stout 

        What he is a-thinking of he doesn't know himself 
        And we wish that he would hurry up and strike strike the bellChorus after each verse:Strike the bell second mate let us go below 
Look well to windward you can see it's gonna blow 

Look at the glass, you can see it has fell 
Oh we wish that you would hurry up

        And strike strike the bell Down on the main deck and working at the pumps
        There is the larboard watch just longing for their bunks 

        Look out to windward, you can see a great swell 
        And we wish that you would hurry up and strike strike the bell Forward on the forecastle head and keeping sharp lookout 
        There is Johnny standing, a- longing for to shout

        Lights a - burning bright sir and everything is well 
        And he's wishing that the second mate would strike strike the bell Aft at the wheelhouse old Anderson stands
        Grasping at the helm with his frostbitten hands 

        Looking at the compass through the course is clear as hell 
        And he's wishing that the second mate would strike strike the bell Aft on the quarter deck our gallant captain stands 
        Looking out to windward with a spyglass in his hand 

        What he is a-thinking of we know very well 
        He's thinking more of shortening sail 

        Than striking the bell "
213,Tarpaulin Jacket,"A tall stalwart lancer lay   dying
        And as on his deathbed he lay
        To his friends who around him were   sighing
        These last dying words he did say
        Wrap me up in my tarpaulin   jacket
        And say a poor buffer lies low
        And six stalwart lancers shall carry   me
        Carry me with steps solemn, mournful and slow.

        Had I the wings of a   little dove
        Far far away would I fly I'd fly
        Straight for the arms of my   true love
        And there I would lay me and die
        Wrap me up in my tarpaulin   jacket
        And say a poor buffer lies low
        And six stalwart lancers shall carry   me
        Carry me with steps solemn mournful and slow

        Then get you two   little white tombstones
        Put them one at my head and my toe my toe
        And get   you a penknife and scratch there
        Here lies a poor buffer below
        Wrap me up   in my tarpaulin jacket
        And say a poor buffer lies low
        And six stalwart   lancers shall carry me
        Carry me with steps solemn mournful and   slow

        And get you six brandies and sodas
        And set them all out in a row   a row
        And get you six jolly good fellows
        To drink to this buffer   below
        Wrap me up in my tarpaulin jacket
        And say a poor buffer lies   low
        And six stalwart lancers shall carry me
        Carry me with steps solemn   mournful and slow

        And then in the calm of the twilight
        When the soft   winds are whispering low so low
        And the darkening shadows are   falling
        Sometimes think of this buffer below
        Wrap me up in my tarpaulin   jacket
        And say a poor buffer lies low
        And six stalwart lancers shall carry   me
        Carry me with steps solemn, mournful and slow "
214,Ten Thousand Miles,"Oh fare you well, my own true love, 
          So fare you well for a while 

          I'm going away, but I'm coming back
If I go ten thousand miles 
          If I prove false to you my love 
          The   earth may melt and burn 

          The sea may freeze and the earth may burn 
          If I   no more return
          Ten thousand miles my own true   love
          Ten thousand miles or more 

          The rocks may melt and the seas may burn 
        If I no more return
          And who will shoe your pretty feet 
          Or who will glove your hand 

          Or who will kiss your red rosy cheek 
          When I'm in the foreign land
          My father will shoe my pretty little   feet 
          My mother will glove my hand 

          And you can kiss my red rosy cheek 
          When you return again
          Oh don't you see yon little turtle dove 
          A skipping from vine to vine 

          A mourning the loss of her own true love 
          Just as I mourn for mine
          Don't you see yon pretty little girl 
          A spinning on yonder wheel 

          Ten thousand gay gold guineas would
          I give   To feel just like she feels"
215,The Single Sailor,"As William and Mary walked by the   sea-side
          Their last farewell to take
          Should you never return young William   she said
          My poor heart will surely break

          Be not thus dismayed young   William he said
          As he pressed the dear maid to his side
          Nor my absence   don't mourn for when I return
          I will make little Mary my bride

          Three   years passed away without news when at last
          As she sat at her own cottage   door
          An old beggar came by with a patch on his eye
          Quite lame and pity did   implore

          If you're charity you'll bestow said he
          I will tell you your   fortune beside
          The lad that you mourn will never return
          To make little   Mary his bride

          Mary started and trembled Oh tell me she cried
          All the   money I've got I will give
          To what I ask you if you will tell me true
          Only   say my dear William live

          In poverty he lives said he
          And shipwrecked   he has been beside
          And return will no more because he is poor
          To make   little Mary his bride

          That he lives Heaven knows the great joy that I   feel
          Yet still his misfortunes I mourn
          For he'd been welcome to me in   poverty
          In his blue jacket tattered and torn

          For I love him so dear so   true and sincere
          That no other I swear beside
          If in riches he rolled and   was clothed in gold
          Should make little Mary his bride

          The patch from   his eye the beggar then threw
          His old coat and his crutch too beside
          With   cheeks like a rose and in jacket so blue
          'Twas William stood by Mary's   side

          Forgive me dear maid then William he said
          Your love it was only I   tried
          To church let's away for ere the sun sets
          I'll make little Mary my   bride"
216,The Token,"
          The breeze was fresh, the ship was in   stays          Each breaker hushed the shore a haze

          When Jack no more on duty   called          His true love's tokens over hauled

          The broken gold, the braided   hair          The tender motto, writ so fair

          Upon his tobacco box he views          Nancy   the poet love the muse
CHORUS after each verse:

          If you loves 
          I as I loves you,          No pair so happy as we two. 


          The storm that like the shapeless wreck  
          Had strewed with rigging all the deck  

          That tars for sharks had given a feast  
          And left the ship a hulk had ceased  

          When Jack, as with his messmates dear  
          He shared the grog their hearts to cheer  

          Took from his tobacco box a quid  
          And spelled for comfort on the lid 

          The battle that with horror grim  
          Had madly ravaged life and limb  

          Had scupper drenched with human gore  
          And widowed many a wife was o'er  

          When Jack to his companions dear  
          First paid the tribute of a tear

          Then O as his tobacco box he held  
          Restored his comfort as he spelled 

          The voyage, that had been long and hard
          But that had yielded full reward  

          And bought each sailor to his friend  
          Happy and rich was at an end  

          When Jack his toils and perils o'er  
          Beheld his Nancy on the shore  

          He then the tobacco box displayed  
          And cried and seized the yielding maid"
217,The Unfortunate Miss Bailey,"A captain bold from Halifax  
        Once left his captain quarters
Seduced a maid who hanged herself 
One morning in her garters

His wicked conscience smitted him  
He lost his stomach daily  
He took to drinking turpentine  
And thought upon Miss Bailey

Oh! Miss Bailey, unfortunate Miss Bailey  

Oh! Miss Bailey, unfortunate Miss Bailey 

One night while sleeping on his ship  
The captain heard a banging  
He left his bed and went on deck  
And saw Miss Bailey hanging  

His timepiece stopped at Midnight  
And his candle burned quite palely
And from the mast a ghost stepped down  
Behold it was Miss Bailey  

Oh! Miss Bailey, unfortunate Miss Bailey   

Oh! Miss Bailey, unfortunate Miss Bailey 

Away, Miss Bailey, he implored  
You don't affright me, really  
Dear Captain Smith, the ghost replied  
You've used me ungenteely  

The coroner was hard on me  
Because I acted frailly
The Parson would not bury me,  
Though I'm a dead Miss Bailey  

Oh! Miss Bailey, unfortunate Miss Bailey

Oh! Miss Bailey, unfortunate Miss Bailey 

You won't believe me when I say  
The captain got soft-hearted  
He gave the ghost a five-pound note  
With which she then departed  

'Twill bribe the sexton for my grave  
And so I leave thee gaily  
Oh bless you, wicked Captain Smith
For rescuing Miss Bailey

218,The Whalefishes,"It was in the year of forty four
          In March   the second day
          That our gallant ship her anchors weighed
          And for the sea   they bore away brave boys
          And for sea they bore awayAnd when we came to far Greenland
          And to   Greenland cold we came
          Where there's frost and snow 
          And the whalefishes   blow brave boys
          And the whalefishes blowOur bosun went to topmast high 
          With his   spyglass in his hand. 
          A whale! there's a whalefish he cried
          And she blows   at every span brave boys
          She blows at every spanOur captain stood on the quarterdeck
          And a   brave little man was he
          Overhaul overhaul on your davit tackles fall 
          And   launch your boats for sea brave boys
          And launch your boats for seaWe struck the whale away he went
          And he   lashed out with his tail
          And we lost the boat and five good men
          And we   never got the whale brave boys
          And we did not get that whaleOh Greenland is an awful place
          Where the   daylight's seldom seen
          Where there's frost and snow

219,Three Score And Ten," And it's three   score and ten 
          Boys and men were lost from Grimsby   Town 
          From Yarmouth down to Scarborough 
          Many hundreds more were drowned 
          Their herring craft and trawlers 
          Their fishing smacks as well 
          Alone they fight the bitter night 
          And battle with the swellMe thinks I see a host of craft
          Spreading   their sails at lee 
          As down the Humber they do steer
          Down for the great   North Sea 
          Me thinks I see a wee small craft 
          And crew with hearts so   brave 
          They go to earn their daily bread 
          Upon the restless   wavesMe thinks I see them yet again
          As they   leave this land behind 
          Casting their nets into the sea
          The herring shoals   to find 
          Me thinks I see them yet again
          And they save on board a right 
          With their sails close-reefed their decks moist cleaned 
          And their   side-lights burning brightOctober's night brought such a sight
          'Twas   never seen before 
          There were masts and yards and broken spars
          Washed up   upon the shore 
          There was many a heart of sorrow
          There was many a heart so   brave 
          There was many a true and noble lad 
          To find a watery   grave"
220,Tom Bowline,"Here a   sheer hulk, lies poor Tom Bowline, 
          The darling of our crew
          No more he'll   hear the tempest howling, 
          For death has broached him too.

          His form was of   the manliest beauty, 
          His heart was kind and soft
          Faithful below, he did   his duty
          And now he's gone aloft. Tom never from his word   departed
          His virtues were so rare
          His friends were many, and true   hearted
          His poll was kind and fair

          And then he'd sing so blithe and   jolly
          Ah! Many's the time and oft
          But mirth is turned to melancholy
          For   Tom  is gone aloftYet shall poor Tom find pleasant   weather
          When He who all commands
          Shall give to call life's crew   together
          The word to pipe all hands

          Thus death who kings and tars   dispatches
          In vain Tom's life has doff'd
          For, though his body under   hatches,
          His soul has gone aloft    "
221,Tom Tough,"My   name, d'ye se's Tom Tough, I've see'd a little service,
          Where mighty billows   roll, and loud tempests blow:
          I've sail'd with valiant Howe, I've sail'd with   noble Jervis,
          And in gallant Duncan's fleet I've sung out Yo! heave   ho!
          Yet more shall ye be knowing, I was coxen to Boscawen,
          And even with   brave Hawke have I nobly faced the foe;
          Then put round the grog, so we've   that on our prog,
          We'll laugh in care's face, And sing Yo! heave ho!
          We'll   laugh in care's face, And sing Yo! heave ho!

          When from my love to part, I   first weighed anchor,
          And she was sniv'lling seen on the beach below;
          I'd   like to've cotch'd my eyes sniv'lling too, d'ye see, to thank her,
          But I   brought my sorrows up with a Yo! heave ho!
          For sailors, tho' they have their   jokes,
          And love and feel like other folks,
          Their duty to neglect must not   come for to go;
          So I seized the capstan bar, like a true, honest tar,
          And   in spite of tears and sighs sang out Yo! heave ho!
          And in spite of tears and   sighs sang out Yo! heave ho!

          But the worst was on't was that time
          When   the little ones were sickly,
          And if they'd live or die, the doctor did not   know;
          The word was gov'd to weigh, so sudden and so quickly,
          I thought my   heart would break as I sang Yo! heave ho!
          For Poll's so like her mother, and   as for Jack, her brother,
          The boy, when he grows up, will nobly face the   foe;
          But in Providence I trust, for you see, what must be, must,
          So my   sighs I gave the wind, and sang out Yo! heave ho!
          So my sighs I gave the   wind, and sang out Yo! heave ho!

          And now at last laid up in a decentish   condition,
          For I've only lost an eye, and got a timber toe;
          But old ships   must expect in time, to be out of commission,
          Nor again the anchor weigh with   a Yo! heave ho!
          So I smoke my pipe and Sing old songs;
          My boys shall well   avenge my wrongs,
          And my girls shall have young sailors
          Nobly for to face   the foe;
          Then to Country and Queen, Fate no danger can mean,
          While the   tars of old England sing out Yo! heave ho!
          While the tars of old England sing   out Yo! heave ho!

223,Top Man And The Afterguard,"The topman and the afterguard were walking one   day
        Said the topman to the afterguard I mean for to pray
        For the rights of   all sailors and the wrongs of all men
        And whatever I do pray for you must   answer Amen
	 Says the afterguard ""Amen"" First I'll pray for the bosun with his little   stick
          He calls out all hands then gives us a lick
          Strikes many a brave   fellow then kicks him a-main
          May the Devil double triple damn him
          Says the   afterguard ""Amen"" Next I'll pray for the Purser who gives us to   eat
          Spew burgers rank butter and musty horsemeat
          With weavily biscuit   while he gets the gain
          May the devil double triple damn him
          Says the   afterguard ""Amen""Then I'll pray for them navy officers who hold   back our due
          We are owed three years wages and prize money too
          Well it's   no pay for you Jack try next voyage again
          May the Devil double triple damn   them
          Says the afterguard ""Amen""Well the last thing that I'll pray for   is a drop of good beer
        For the Lord made the liquor our spirits for to   cheer
        And where we had one pot I wish we had ten
        And never never want for   grog my boys
			Said the afterguard ""Amen. "
224,Van Diemens Land,"Come all you gallant   poachers        That ramble free from care
          That walk out of a moonlight   night 
          With your dog your gun and snare
          Where the lusty hare and   pheasant          You have at your command
          Not thinking that your last career          Is   on Van Diemen's Land

          There was poor Tom Brown from Nottingham          Jack   Williams and poor Joe
          Were three as daring poachers          As the country well   does know
          At night they were trepanned          By the keepers hid in sand
          And   for fourteen years transported were          Unto Van Diemen's Land

          Oh! when we   sailed from England          We landed at the bay
          We had rotten straw for   bedding          We dared not to say nay
          Our cots were fenced with fire          we   slumber when we can
          To drive away the wolves and tigers          Upon Van Diemen's   Land

          Oh! when that we were landed          Upon that fatal shore
          The   planters they came flocking round          Full twenty score or more
          They ranked us   up like horses          And sold us out of hand
          They yoked us to the plough my   boys          To plough Van Diemen's Land

          There was one girl from   England          Susan Summers was her name
          For fourteen years transported   was          We all well knew the same
          Our planter bought her freedom          And he   married her out of hand
          Good usage then she gave to us          Upon Van Diemen's   Land

          Oh! oft when I am slumbering          I have a pleasant dream
          With my   sweet girl I am sitting          Down by some purling stream
          Through England I am   roaming          With her at my command
          Then waken brokenhearted          Upon Van   Diemen's Land

          God bless our wives and families          Likewise that happy   shore
          That isle of sweet contentment          Which we shall see no more
          As for   our wretched females          See them we seldom can
          There are twenty to one   woman          Upon Van Diemen's Land

          Come all you gallant poachers          Give ear   unto my song
          It is a bit of good advice          Although it is not long
          Lay by   your dog and snare          To you I do speak plain
          If you knew the hardships we   endure          You ne'er would poach again                 "

229,When I Was A Lad,"Gilbert & Sullivan 1878 from the play H.M.S. Pinafore When I was a lad I served a term As office boy to an Attorney's firm I cleaned the windows and I swept the floor And I polished up the handle of the big front door He polished up the handle of the big front door I polished up that handle so carefully That now I am the Ruler of the Queen's Navy He polished up that handle so carefully That now he is the ruler of the Queen's Navy As office boy I made such a mark  That they gave me the post of a junior clerk I served the writs with a smile so bland And I copied all the letters in a big round hand He copied all the letters in a big round hand I copied all the letters in a hand so free That now I am the Ruler of the Queen's Navy He copied all the letters in a hand so free That now he is the Ruler of the Queen's Navy In serving writs I made such a name That an articled clerk I soon became I wore clean collars and a brand-new suit For the pass examination at the Institute For the pass examination at the Institute. And that pass examination did so well for me That now I am the Ruler of the Queen's Navy That pass examination did so well for he That now he is the Ruler of the Queen's Navy Of legal knowledge I acquired such a grip That they took me into the partnership  And that junior partnership, I ween Was the only ship that I ever had seen Was the only ship that he ever had seen. But that kind of ship so suited me That now I am the Ruler of the Queen's Navy But that kind of ship so suited he That now he is the ruler of the Queen's Navy I grew so rich that I was sent By a pocket borough into Parliament I always voted at my party's call And I never thought of thinking for myself at all He never thought of thinking for himself at all. I thought so little, they rewarded me By making me the Ruler of the Queen's Navy He thought so little, they rewarded he By making him the Ruler of the Queen's Navy Now landsmen all, whoever you may be If you want to rise to the top of the tree If your soul isn't fettered to an office stool Be careful to be guided by this golden rule Be careful to be guided by this golden rule. Stick close to your desks and never go to sea, And you all may be rulers of the Queen's Navy Stick close to your desks and never go to sea And you all may be rulers of the Queen's Navy "

233,Why Should We Quarrel For Riches,"How pleasant a sailor's life passes Who roams o'er the watery main No treasure he ever amasses But cheerfully spends all his gain We're strangers to party and faction To honor and honesty true And would not commit a bad action For power or profit in view CHORUS after each verse: 

          Then why should we quarrel for riches 
              

        Or any such glittering toys 

        A light heart, and a thin pair of breeches 

Will go through the world, my brave boys The world is a beautiful garden Enriched with the blessings of life The toiler with plenty rewarding Which plenty too often breeds strife When terrible tempests assail us And mountainous billows affright No grandeur or wealth can avail us But skilful industry steers right The courtier's more subject to dangers Who rules at the helm of the state Than we that, to politics strangers Escape the snares laid for the great The various blessings of nature In various nations we try No mortals than us can be greater Who merrily live till we die "
234,Will Watch,"One morn when the wind from the northward blew   keenly
          While sullenly reared the big waves of the main
          A famed smuggler   Will Watch kissed his Sue then serenely
          Took helm and to sea boldly steered   out again.
          Will had promised his Sue that his trip if well ended
          Should   coil up his hopes and he'd anchor on shore
          When his pockets were lined, why   his life should be mended
          The laws he had broken he'd never break   more

          His sea boat was trim made her port took her lading
          Then Will   stood for home reached the offing and cried
          This night if I've luck furls the   sail of my trading
          In dock I can lie serve a friend too beside
          Will lay-to   till night came on, darksome and dreary
          To crowd every sail then he piped up   each hand
          But a signal soon 'spied - 'twas a prospect uncheery-
          A signal   that warned them to steer from the land.

          ""The Philistines are out cries   Will - we'll take no heed on't
          Attacked whose the man who will flinch from   his gun
          Should my head be blown off I shall ne'er feel the need on't
          We'll   fight while we can when we can't boys  we'll run
          Through the haze of the   night a bright flash now appearing,
          Oh oh cries Will Watch the Philistines   bear down
          Bear a hand, my tight lads ere we think about sheering 
          One   broadside pour in should we swim boys or drown.

          But should I be popped   off you, my mates left behind me
          Regard my last words see 'em kindly   obeyed
          Let no stone mark the spot and my friends do you mind me
          Near the   beach is the grave where Will Watch would be laid
          Poor Will's yarn was spun   out - for a bullet next minute
          Laid him low on the deck and he never spoke   more
          His bold crew fought the brig while a shot remained in it
          Then   sheered off and Will's hulk to his Susan they bore

          In the dead of the   night his last wish was complied with
          To few known his grave and to few known   his end
          He was borne to the earth by the crew that he died with
          He'd the   tears of his Susan the prayers of each friend
          Near his grave dash the billows   the winds loudly bellow
          Yon ash, struck with lightning points out the cold   bed
          Where Will Watch the bold smuggler that famed lawless fellow
          Once   feared now forgot sleeps in peace with the dead"

Won't you go my way
          I met her in the morning  
Won't you go my way

          In   the morning bright and early
          Won't you go my way

          Won't you go my way
          I asked that girl to marry
          Won't you go my   way

          She said she'd rather tarry
          Won't you go my way
          She said she'd   rather tarry
          Won't you go my way

          Oh marry never tarry

237,Yankee Man O War,"
          'Tis of a   gallant Yankee ship
          That flew the stripes and stars
          And the whistling wind   from the west nor'west
          Blew through the pitch pine spars
          With her   starboard tacks aboard my boys
          She hung upon the gale on an autumn   night
          We raised the light on the old head of Kinsale

          It was a clear   and cloudless night
          And the wind blew steady and strong
          As fairly over the   sparkling deep
          Our good ship bowled along
          With the foaming seas beneath   her bow
          The fiery waves she spread
          And bending low her bosom of   snow
          She buried her lee cat-head

          There was no talk of shortening   sail
          by him who walked the poop
          And under the press of her pondering   jib
          The boom bent like a hoop
          And the groaning waterways told the   strain
          That held her stout main tack
          But he only laughed as he glanced   aloft
          At a white and silvery track

          The nightly robes our good ship   wore
          Were her own topsails three
          Her spanker and her standing jib
          The   courses being free
          Now lay aloft my heroes bold
          Let not a moment   pass
          And royals and topgallant sails
          Were quickly on each mast

          What   looms upon our starboard bow
          What hangs upon the breeze
          'Tis time our good   ship hauled her wind
          Abreast of the old saltee's
          For by her ponderous   press of sail
          And by her escorts four
          We saw our morning visitor
          Was a   British man-of-war

          Up spoke our noble captain then
          And a short ahead   of us passed
          Haul snug your flowing courses!
          Lay your topsail to the   mast
          Those Englishmen gave three loud hurrahs
          From the deck of their   covered ark
          And we answered by a solid broadside
          From the deck of our   patriot bark

          Out booms! Out booms! our skipper cried
          Out booms! and   give her sheet
          And the swiftest keel that ever was launched
          Shot ahead of   the British fleet
          And amidst a thundering shower of shot
          With the   stun-sails hoisting away
          Down the north channel Paul Jones did steer
          Just   at the break of day"
238,Ye Mariners,"Ye mariners all, as ye pass by
          Come   in and drink if you are dry
          Come spend, me lads, your money brisk
          And pop   your nose in a jug of this

          Oh mariners all, if you've half a   crown
          You're welcome all for to sit down
          Come spend, me lads, your money   brisk
          And pop your nose in a jug of this

          Oh tipplers all, as you pass   by
          Come in and drink if you are dry
          Come in and drink, think not   amiss
          And pop your nose in a jug of this

          Oh now I'm old and can   scarcely crawl
          I've a long grey beard and a head that's bald
          Crown my   desire, fulfill my bliss
          A pretty girl and a jug of this

          And when I'm   in my grave and dead
          And all my sorrows are past and fled
          Transform me   then into a fish
          And let me swim in a jug of this"
239,Ye Parliament Of England,"Ye Parliament of England          You Lords   and commons too
          Consider well what you're about 
          And what you're going to   do 
          You're now to fight with Yankees 
          I'm sure you'll rue the day
          You   roused the Sons of Liberty In North AmericaYou first confined our commerce          And said   our ships sha'n't trade
          You next impressed our seamen          And used them as   your slaves
          You then insulted Rogers          While plowing o'er the main
          And   had we not declared war          You'd have done it o'er againYou thought our frigates were but few          And   Yankees would not fight
          Until brave Hull your Guerriere took          And banished   her from your sight
          The Wasp then took your Frolic          We'll nothing say to   that
          The Poitiers being of the line          Of course she took her backThen next upon Lake Erie  
          Where Perry had   some fun
          You own he beat your naval force          And caused them for to   run
          This was to you a sore defeat          The like ne'er known before
          Your   British Squadron beat complete          Some took some run ashoreThere's Rogers in the President          Will burn   sink and destroy 
          The Congress on the Brazil coast          Your commerce will   annoy
          The Essex in the South Seas          Will put out all your lights
          The flag   she waves at her mast-head          Free Trade and Sailors' RightsLament ye sons of Britain          Far distant is   the day 
          When you'll regain by British force          What you're lost in   America
          Go tell your King and parliament          By all the world 'tis   known
          That British force by sea and land          By Yankees are   overthrownUse every endeavor          And strive to make a   peace
          For Yankee ships are building fast          Their Navy to increase
          They   will enforce their commerce          The laws by Heaven were made
          That Yankee ships   in time of peace          To any port may trade"
240,Yo Ho Ho And A Bottle Of Rum,"Fifteen men on a dead man's chest
Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum
Drink and the devil had done for the rest
Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum.
The mate was fixed by the bosun's pike
The bosun brained with a marlinspike
And cookey's throat was marked belike
It had been gripped by fingers ten;
And there they lay, all good dead men
Like break o'day in a boozing ken.
Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum.Fifteen men of the whole ship's list
          Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum!
          Dead and be damned and the rest gone whist!
          Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum!
          The skipper lay with his nob in gore
          Where the scullion's axe his cheek had shore
          And the scullion he was stabbed times four
          And there they lay, and the soggy skies
          Dripped down in up-staring eyes
          In murk sunset and foul sunrise
          Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum.Fifteen men of 'em stiff and stark
          Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum!
          Ten of the crew had the murder mark!
          Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum!
          Twas a cutlass swipe or an ounce of lead
          Or a yawing hole in a battered head
          And the scuppers' glut with a rotting red
          And there they lay, aye, damn my eyes
          Looking up at paradise
          All souls bound just contrariwise
          Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum.Fifteen men of 'em good and true
          Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum!
          Ev'ry man jack could ha' sailed with Old Pew,
          Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum!
          There was chest on chest of Spanish gold
          With a ton of plate in the middle hold
          And the cabins riot of stuff untold,
          And they lay there that took the plum
          With sightless glare and their lips struck dumb
          While we shared all by the rule of thumb,
          Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum!More was seen through a sternlight screen...
          Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum
          Chartings undoubt where a woman had been
          Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum.
          'Twas a flimsy shift on a bunker cot
          With a dirk slit sheer through the bosom spot
          And the lace stiff dry in a purplish blot
          Oh was she wench or some shudderin' maid
          That dared the knife and took the blade
          By God! she had stuff for a plucky jade
          Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum.Fifteen men on a dead man's chest
          Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum
          Drink and the devil had done for the rest
          Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum.
          We wrapped 'em all in a mains'l tight
          With twice ten turns of a hawser's bight
          And we heaved 'em over and out of sight,
          With a Yo-Heave-Ho! and a fare-you-well
          And a sudden plunge in the sullen swell
          Ten fathoms deep on the road to hell,
          Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum!"
241,Young Monroe,"Come all you true-born shanty   boys          Wherever you may be
          Come sit you on the deacon seat          And listen to   me
          I'll sing the jam on Gerry's Rock          And a hero you should know
          The   bravest of all shanty-boys          The foreman Young MonroeIt was on a Sunday morning          As you   will quickly hear
          Our logs were piled mountain high          We could not keep them   clear
          Our foreman said Come cheer up lads 
          With heart relieved of   fear
          We'll break the jam on Gerry's Rock          And for Saginaw we'll   steerNow some of them were willing          While   others they were not
          For to work on jams on Sunday          They did not think we   ought
          But six of our Canuck boys          Did volunteer to go
          And break the jam   on Gerry's Rock          With the foreman Young MonroeThey had not rolled off many   logs          When they heard his clear voice say
          I'd have you lads on your   guard          For the jam will soon give way
          These words were hardly   spoken          When the mass did break and go
          And it carried of those six brave   lads          And their foreman Young MonroeWhen the rest of our shanty boys          The   sad news came to hear
          In search of their dead comrades          To the river they   did steer
          Some of the mangled bodies          A-floating down did go
          While   crushed and bleeding near the bank 
          Was that of Young MonroeThey took him from his watery   grave          Smoothed back his raven hair
          There was one fair girl among   them          Whose sad cries rent the air
          There was one fair form among them          A   maid from Saginaw town
          Whose moans and cries rose to the skies          For her   true lover who'd gone downFor Clara was a nice young girl          The   riverman's true friend
          She with her widowed mother dear          Lived near the   river's bend
          The wages of her own true love          The boss to her did pay
          And   the shanty-boys for her made up          A generous purse next dayThey buried him with sorrow   deep          'Twas on the first of May
          Come all you brave shanty-boys          And for   your comrade pray
          Engraved upon a hemlock tree          That by the grave did   grow
          Was the name and date of the sad fate          Of the foreman Young   MonroeFair Clara did not long survive          Her   heart broke with her grief
          And scarcely two months later          Death came to her   relief
          And when this time had passed away          And she was called to go
          Her   last request was granted          To rest beside Young Monroe    Come all you brave shanty boys        I   would have you call and see
          Those two green mounds by the riverside          Where   grows the hemlock tree
          The shanty-boys cleared off the wood          By the lovers   there laid low
