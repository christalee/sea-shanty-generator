380,abdul abulbul amir,the sons of the prophet are brave men and bold and quite unaccustomed to fear but the bravest by far in the ranks of the shah was abdul abulbul amir if you wanted a man to encourage the van or harass the foe from the rear storm fort or redoubt you had only to shout for abdul abulbul amir now the heroes were plenty and well known to fame in the troops that were led by the czar and the bravest of these was a man by the name of ivan skavinsky skavar one day this bold russian he shouldered his gun and donned his most truculent sneer downtown he did go where he tred on the toe of abdul abulbul amir young man quote abdul has life grown so dull that you wish to end your career vile infidel know you have trod on the toe of abdul abulbul amir so take your last look at the sunshine and brook and send your regrets to the czar for by this i imply you are going to die count ivan skavinsky skavar then this bold mameluke drew his trusty skibouk singing allah il allah al lah and with murderous intent he ferociously went for ivan skavinsky skavar they parried and thrust they side stepped and cussed of blood they spilled a great part the philologist blokes who seldom crack jokes say that hash was first made on the spot they fought all that night neath the pale yellow moon the din it was heard from afar and huge multitudes came so great was the fame of abdul and ivan skavar as abdul s long knife was extracting the life in fact he was shouting huzzah he felt himself struck by that wily calmuck count ivan skavinsky skavar the sultan drove by in his red breasted fly expecting the victor to cheer but he only drew nigh to hear the last sigh of abdul abulbul amir there s a tomb rises up where the blue danube rolls and graved there in characters clear is stranger when passing oh pray for the soul of abdul abulbul amir a splash in the black sea one dark moonless night caused ripples to spread wide and far it was made by a sack fitting close to the back of ivan skavinsky skavar a muscovite maiden her lone vigil keeps neath the light of the cold northern star and the name that she murmurs in vain as she weeps is ivan skavinsky skavar
381,auckland to the bluff,i left the city when just a lad times were hard and no work to be had so i went to sea on the florabelle little did i know twas a ship from hellthe ship was old and leaking at the seams a dirty old tub somewhat broad in the beam its sails were torn some planks were rotten it lay at the wharf a gently rockingi ve sailed from auckland to the bluff a thousand miles and that s enough a thousand miles on the heaving sea glory halleju that s enough for mewe set sail on the evening tide it was early on a saturday night all went well till the tiri light then by god i got a frightthe ship was hit by a big beam sea christ i thought it was all up with me she rolled and she lolloped like a big tin drum hell i thought me time had come chorus shorten sails the skipper cried shorten sails or you buggers will all die get aloft get aloft get up the mast get aloft get aloft and get up there fastnever in my life had i been so scared never in my life had i wished i was dead but i climbed the mast and shortened sail then i climbed down again and was sick o er the rail chorus man the pumps the skipper roared man the pumps or you ll sail the ocean floor so i pumped all night though my hands were raw and i pumped and i pumped till the coming of the dawnhow we survived that night i don t know the wind it did roar and the wind it did blow but the sun came up and the sea went down the wind did ease and we headed south chorus for breakfast we had mouldy bread for lunch it was the very same fare for supper we had a stinking stew cookie couldn t eat his own damned brewthe skipper was an old man old and mean tough as nails and just as lean voice like a foghorn in the gloom when he cursed was a voice of doom chorus the work was hard and the pay was mean the food was rotten and the quarters none too clean the journey south was always rough so i jumped the ship when we pulled into bluffso here in bluff i ll settle down never again will i leave this town never again will i go to sea never again will it see mewhy is there no mp of this song are you people trying to make profits off a ship that probably went down in the straights years ago have you dummies lost your minds men died you do not own their heritage is this some fuckin half assed attempt by kiwis to make money off the backs of true seamen you are assholes i hope i meet you someday so that i may set you straight and i will you bunch of faggots new zealand sucks my shitty ass dolts thanks for your comments tracey i will try to reply to them one by one there is no mp of this song because this is just a resource site and not a shop if you want a copy please let me know and i can put you in touch with the maritime crew who can sell you a cd are we trying to make a profit off this site in the interest of full disclosure we have had one ad click from this so far which gives us the grand total of cents so no i m not sure how to break this to you but the ship mentioned in the above song is fictional and didn t actually go down in the straights years ago no men died it actually doesn t even go down at all in the song you may be interested to know that the narrative of the main character in the song has been expanded by the author rudy sunde in a recent immigration production at lopdell house in titirangi auckland where the once traumatised sailor grows up to be a sea captain an interesting point you raise is that we do not own the heritage of our own sea music i think that this is an intriguing point as in who does own the heritage of their folk songs and what defines ownership if anyone could lay claim to the heritage of the nz folk scene it should surely be all nz ers and those who enjoy the music as to you hoping to meet me someday to set me straight then i truly hope that comes to pass the only real way this can be resolved is a good old fashioned shanty off the way it works is that you start with a shanty to try and put us off our game then we respond trying to beat your shanty it goes on like that until one of us gives up and the other one wins the shanty battle it s just like break dancing really why do you folk not publish this song for free it is not all about money you know maybe down south there you think that we in the north want something for free but this song existed long before you or you daddies were born in canada we would hunt you down and kick your asses i guess in your hearts you believe that you are pulling one over on the grasping western democracies but all you are doing in preventing canadians and americans and anybody else from hearing these songs are you just crazy or perhaps you are just a bunch of greedy druncken fools traceyolson yahoo com i am a man btw i noticed your previous reply to me but i never recieved a reply from you or the group that made this song i originally wrote about three or four years ago there is a good chance that i will come down there and when i do i am sure that i will be out numbered but in the meantime can you not convince your friends to give us a break up here up north we just want to hear your songs we love you folk tracebtw if you fellas need some money just tell me how much and i will send it to you i have the lyrics already i could get some men up here to sing it but it would not be the same as you men singin it help me out my email is traceyolson yahoo com help me put ok tracetrace you ve been drunk messaging haven t you haven t you let me explain most drunken conversations tend to follow a simple pattern excitement why do you folk not publish this song for free note the double question mark to express incredulity if we were at a party i imagine that at this point you would be talking a bit too loud and standing a bit too close possibly interrupting a conversation i would be having with somebody else aggression in canada we would hunt you down and kick your asses i imagine if you said that to me at a party you would kind of laugh while saying it to not incite an actual fight but then stop laughing abruptly and stare at me a little too long to make sure that i knew you were serious confusion i noticed your previous reply to me but i never recieved a reply from you at this point i would be looking sheepishly around the place trying to catch someone s eye i might also give an apologetic smile to the host of the party you know the one the smile that says i know he s drunk i ll tolerate him because it s a party and you kind of expect that sort of thing empathy love can you not convince your friends to give us a break up here up north we just want to hear your songs we love you folk trace this is the part of the conversation that starts getting really uncomfortable i imagine you would start hugging me suddenly and without warning and then saying over and over again that you really like me and though we have just met i think we should keep in touch and swap songs and maybe have a jam sometime i just bought a mountain dulcimer and i haven t learnt to play it but wouldn t it be so awesome if i played it and so on and after all that i walk away not really knowing what just happened or why but wishing i could get the last mins back i m not sure if the aforementioned responders noticed that the shanty was written in that being said the gentleman who wrote the song deserves to be paid for it as far as making profit from tragedy here s one i wrote this year taken from sharpe who i believe to be an actual soldier a member of the th rifles during the napoleonic war the series on bbc chronicles the man but the actual melody and different lyrics were actually written in i ve updated the lyrics to the popular conflict in the middle east for fourteen years we ve been at war and no one seems to know what for islam keeps us us well at bay over the hills and far away o er the hills and far away to iraq afghanistan george bush command and we did stray over the hills and far away cheney waves his bloody hand and kills young people from this land halliburton we still pay over the hills and far away instead of spending precious youth send tired old men to fight for truth then they can die for what they say over the hills and far away no i m not making any money for this just enjoyenjoythank you so much for posting this shanty it was one of my late husband s favorites great song and i was looking all over the web for an upcoming shanty sing in his honor many thanks
