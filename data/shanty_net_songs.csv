    (A-hay O! To me O!)
“Now where did Frankie learn his trade?
For he ran me down with a three-reef mains’le.”
    (All round the Horn!)Atlantic answered: “Not from me!
    (A-hay O! To me O!)
You’d better ask the cold North Sea,
For he ran me down under all plain canvas.”
    (All round the Horn!)The North Sea answered: “He’s my man,
    (A-hay O! To me O!)
For he came to me when he began–
It’s Frankie Drake in an open coaster.
    (All round the Sands!)“I caught him young and I used him sore,
    (A-hay O! To me O!)
So you never shall startle Frankie more,
Without capsizing Earth and her waters.
    (All round the Sands!)“I did not favour him at all,
    (A-hay O! To me O!)
I made him pull and I made him haul–
And stand his trick with the common sailors.
    (All round the Sands!)“I froze him stiff and I fogged him blind,
    (A-hay O! To me O!)
And kicked him home with his road to find
By what he could see of a three-day snow-storm.
    (All round the Sands!)“I learned him his trade o’ winter nights,
    (A-hay O! To me O!)
‘Twixt Mardyk Fort and Dunkirk lights
On a five-knot tide with the forts a-firing.
    (All round the Sands!)“Before his beard began to shoot,
    (A-hay O! To me O!)
I showed him the length of the Spaniard’s foot–
And I reckon he clapped the boot on it later.
    (All round the Sands!)“If there’s a risk which you can make
    (A-hay O! To me O!)
That’s worse than he was used to take
Nigh every week in the way of his business;
    (All round the Sands!)“If there’s a trick that you can try
    (A-hay O! To me O!)
Which he hasn’t met in time gone by,
Not once or twice, but ten times over;
    (All round the Sands!)“If you can teach him aught that’s new,
    (A-hay O! To me O!)
I’ll give you Bruges and Niewport too,
And the ten tall churches that stand between ’em.”
    (All round the Sands!)
So storm along, my gallant Captains!

A sailor’s life was very hard, the food was always bad
But now I’ve joined the navy, I’m aboard a man-o-war
And now I’ve found a sailor ain’t a sailor any moreDon’t haul on the rope, don’t climb up the mast

Just get your civies ready for another run ashore
A sailor ain’t a sailor, ain’t a sailor anymoreWell the killock of our mess he says we’ve had it soft
It wasn’t like this in his day when he was up aloft
We like our bunks and sleeping bags, but what’s a hammock for?
Swinging from the deckhead, or lying on the floor?ChorusWell they gave us an engine that first went up and down
Then with more technology the engine went around
We know our steam and diesel but what’s a mainyard for?
A stoker ain’t a stoker with a shovel anymore.ChorusWell they gave us Aldiss lamp so we could do it right
They gave us a radio, we signaled day and night
We know our codes and cyphers but what’s a semaphore?
A bunting-tosser doesn’t toss the bunting anymoreChorusTwo cans of beer a day and that’s your bleeding lot
Now we get an extra one because they’ve stopped the tot
So we’ll put on our civie clothes and find a pub ashore

                  Star of the County Down |                     ","
In Banbridge Town in the County Down
One morning last July,
From a boreen green came a sweet colleen
And she smiled as she passed me by.

She looked so sweet from her two bare feet
To the sheen of her nut brown hair.
Such a coaxing elf, sure I shook myself
For to see I was really there.

From Bantry Bay up to Derry Quay and
From Galway to Dublin Town,
No maid I’ve seen like the brown colleen
That I met in the County Down.

As she onward sped, sure I turned my head,
And I looked with a feelin’ rare,
And I say’s, say’s I, to a passer-by,
“Whose the maid with the nut brown hair”?
He smiled at me and he says, say’s he,
“That’s the jewel of Ireland’s crown.
It’s Rosie McCann from the banks of the Bann,
She’s the star of the County Down”.


Chorus

At the Harvest Fair she’ll be surely there
And I’ll dress in my Sunday clothes,
With my shoes shone bright and my hat cocked right
For a smile from my nut brown rose.
No pipe I’ll smoke, no horse I’ll yoke
Till my plough turns rust colored brown.
Till a smiling bride, by my own fireside
Sits the star of the County Down.

By a lonely prison wall,
I heard a young girl calling
Michael they are taking you away,
For you stole Trevelyn’s corn
So the young might see the morn,
Now a prison ship lies waiting in the bay

Low lie, The Fields Of Athenry
 Where once we watched the small free birds fly
 Our love was on the wing
 We had dreams and songs to sing,
 Its so lonely round the Fields of Athenry


By a lonely prison wall
I heard a young man calling
‘Nothing matters Mary, when you’re free’
Against the famine and the crown,
I rebelled, they ran me down
Now its so lonely round the Fields of Athenry

By a lonely harbour wall
She watched the last star falling
As the prison ship sailed out against the sky
Sure she’ll live in hope and pray
For her love in Botany Bay
Its so lonely round the Fields of Athenry

Twenty leagues away from shore

All his precious blood did spill,

And I vowed at every breath,
Oh to walk in wisdom’s path,

But my repentance lasted not,
My vows I soon forgot,

Laws no more I’ll mock as I sail,

As the mainsails unfurled, our curses we hurled
On the English, and thoughts of tomorrowAt the mouth of the Foyle, bid farewell to the soil
As down below decks we were lying

By a vision of bold Robert dying

Our ship danced like a moth in the firelight
White horses rode high as the devil passed by
Taking souls to Hades by twilight
Five weeks out to sea, we were now forty-three
We buried our comrades each morning
In our own slime we were lost in a time
Of endless night without dawningCHORUSVan Diemen’s land is a hell for a man
To end out his whole life in slavery
Where the climate is raw and the gun makes the law
Neither wind nor rain care for bravery
Twenty years have gone by, I’ve ended my bond
My comrades ghosts walk behind me
A rebel I came – I’m still the same
On the cold winters night you will find meCHORUS"

and away an away i went to the pub
I walked down old Miami drive
and there at Malone’s i did soon arrivewell the lights were on there was music inside
and there were people i did know
i started to drink and to talk out of me arse
i drank all my money and i drank it fast“now who shall buy poor stefan a pint?!”
“for ive spent all my money on this fine night”
as soon as the free drinks were all gone
stefan found a buddy and he latched on….So i challenged this man to a noble duel
that would take place as a game of pool
whomever so should happen to win the round
shall be given drink on the losers poundNow the terms were set and agreed upon
and soon twas I was the losing one
I said “good sir i have lied to you”
“for I have as much money as ive skill in pool”He said never mind and he brought me more
and we drank till the pub did close its door
all of the drunks were now stood outside
“I need more drink!!” poor stefan criedthe man said ive more brew of me own
if any of ye wud like tay follow me home
the mob did agree and we all did go
away and aw-a down a Waiheke road…Soon i looked around and me crew were gone
and me and the man we were all alone
“is this some sort of gay thing?” i said to the night
“no” said the man “everythings alright”Well good says i and on we sped
until we came to me new mates shed
we had more drink and then he looked at me and said
“do you know stefan that i have a spa“this is not appropriate” stefan said he explained
“i have a wife and im not gay!”
why dont we just now call it day
then he said we went and put his clothes onwho could say what really happened next?
for poor wee stefan he never said
did he go a-home and go straight to bed?
or did he have a snuggle wid the gay man?His wife said he come home with no pants
and he was soaking head to toe
and that was the tale of our bold stefan clist
or at least thats the story he told……….THE END……..or was it?"

Until she reached the Manukau Bar
There her race was runChorusThe Manukau Harbour is a haven safe
From the raging storm

Powered by steam and sail
But her mighty engines could not save

Shoots her eggs out in the sea,

Always there when duty calls.

at the Catlins River yard of Will McPhee
From native timbers she was made, of the very finest grade
They built her tough to survive the Southern SeaGaff and topsail on her main and her mizzen the same
And a pair of pulling on her fore
Cut the water like a hake, left her rivals in her wake
Showed her style in grin her captain wore She was stout and tall and handsome from her bow to her transom
She’d a lively but sea kindly manner
Carried forty tons with ease though those wild Southern seas
A legend of the south was the AnnaIt was Captain George Stout who first took her out
With a cargo of timber northward bound
In the sou’west wind she flew, up the coast to Timaru
Then a load of grain for old Dunedin townMany voyages she made, port to port she plied her trade
Proving fast and safe with ballast in her hold
She made every voyage pay until strangely one day
Her owner decreed that she be sold[Chorus]It was Captain Stephen Tall who answered Anna’s call
A man of high adventure and pluck
He had weathered many gales and was full of salty tales
How he’d cheated death with courage, skill and luckThen in stormy Foveuax, Captain Tall met his fate
On a black and angry night they ran aground
Only hull and deck were saved from a cold watery grave
But her captain and crew were never found[Chorus]Captains Anglem, Burke and Drew and the Anna built anew
All turned their hands to fishin’ and to sealin’
But it was Captain Wood who ran from Mr Greig the government man
Who knew but couldn’t prove that they were stealingSo he chased them all the way down to Perseverance Bay
Just to find that the crew had long since landed
Though he searched till he was blind not a sealskin could he find
Cursed the Anna as he sailed off empty handed[Chorus]Then came Captain ‘Young Bill’ Hanning master seamen of high standing
He and Anna became a champion team
Ten exciting years they shared carrying anything anywhere
On the southern coast the Anna reigned supremeThen one day a monster swell became the dreaded wave from hell
Right down the deck that lump of ocean flew
Captain Hanning and John Joss – swept overboard and lost
‘Twas the saddest day the Anna ever knew[Chorus]Though her soul mate Bill was gone still the Anna battled on
Doing every kind of work a good ship could find
Then after forty years of sailing her timbers were ailin’
She was beached and broken up for firewoodNow on a cold and stormy night if there’s an eerie blue light
Flickering in the fire so surreal
It’s Anna’s spirit reaching free on that great heavenly sea

And vowed to sail her never more[Chorus]Ever since that night I’ve been on the road

Bulging at the trousers with a cock of solid oak.
At sea without a woman for seven years or more –
There wasn’t any need to ask what he was looking for.[Chorus]He asked her for a candlestick to light his way to bed,
He asked her for pillow just to rest his weary head.
And speaking very gently just as if he meant no harm,
He asked her if she’d come to bed just so’s to keep him warm.[Chorus]She lifted up the blanket and a moment there did lie;
He was on her, he was in her in the twinkling of an eye.
He was in again and out again and fucking up a storm,
And the only thing she said to him, “I hope you’re keeping warm.”[Chorus]So early the next morning the sailor he arose
Saying, “Here’s a 10-pound note my dear for the damage I have caused.
If you have a daughter, bounce her on your knee,
And if you have a son, send the bastard off to sea.”[Chorus]Now she sits upon the dock a baby at her knee,

Waiting for them jolly tars in Navy uniform

He’d take that whale in tow.Before the boat had hit the water
The whale’s tail came up and caught her.
All hands to the side harpooned and fought her
When she dived down below.No line was cut, no whale was freed;
The Captain’s mind was not of greed,
But he belonged to the whaleman’s creed;
She took the ship in tow.For forty days, or even more,
The line went slack, then tight once more.
All boats were lost (there were only four)

On the Fourth of July Eighteen Hundred and SixWe set sail from the sweet cove of CorkWe were sailing away with a cargo of bricksFor the grand City Hall in New York’twas a wonderful craft she was rigged fore and aftAnd oh how the wild winds drove herShe stood several blasts she had twenty seven mastsAnd they called her the Irish Rover2.     We had one million bags of the best Sligo ragsWe had two million barrels of stoneWe had three million sides of blind horses hidesWe had four million barrels of bonesWe had five million hogs and six million dogsSeven million barrels of porterWe had eight million bails of old nanny goats’ tailsIn the hold of the Irish Rover3.     There was old Mickey Coote who played hard on his fluteWhen the ladies lined up for a setHe was tootling with skill for each sparkling quadrilleThough the dancers were fluther’d and betWith his smart witty talk he was cock of the walkAnd he rolled the dames under and overThey all knew at a glance when he took up his stanceThat he sailed in the Irish Rover4.     There was Barney McGee from the Banks of the DeeThere was Hogan from County TyroneThere was Johnny McGurk who was scared stiff of workAnd a man from Westmeath called MaloneThere was Slugger O’Toole who was drunk as a ruleAnd fighting Bill Treacy from DoverAnd your man Mick MacCann from the banks of the BannWas the skipper on the Irish Rover5.     We had sailed seven years when the measles broke outAnd the ship lost its way in the fogAnd that whale of a crew was reduced down to twoJust myself and the Captain’s old dogThen the ship struck a rock oh Lord what a shockThe bulkhead was turned right overTurned nine times around and the poor old dog was drownedAnd the last of the Irish Rover

Then one evening her flame of love blew out
Blow me down and pick me up!
She swapped me for a troutThere was Typhoon Tessie, met her on the coast of Java
When we kissed I bubbled up like molten lava
Then she told me and gave me the scare of my young life

Left the girls of Tuam, Nearly broken hearted,
Saluted father dear, Kissed my darlin’ mother,
Drank a pint of beer, My grief and tears to smother,
Then off to reap the corn, And leave where I was born,
I cut a stout blackthorn, To banish ghost and goblin,
In a brand new pair of brogues, I rattled o’er the bogs,
And frightened all the dogs,On the rocky road to Dublin.One, two, three, four five,
Hunt the hare and turn her
Down the rocky road
And all the ways to Dublin,
Whack-fol-lol-de-ra.In Mullingar that night, I rested limbs so weary,
Started by daylight, Next mornin’ light and airy,
Took a drop of the pure, To keep my heart from sinkin’,
That’s an Irishman’s cure, Whene’er he’s on for drinking.
To see the lasses smile, Laughing all the while,
At my curious style, ‘Twould set your heart a-bubblin’.
They ax’d if I was hired, The wages I required,
Till I was almost tired, Of the rocky road to Dublin.In Dublin next arrived, I thought it such a pity,
To be so soon deprived, A view of that fine city.
Then I took a stroll, All among the quality,
My bundle it was stole, In a neat locality;
Something crossed my mind, Then I looked behind;
No bundle could I find, Upon my stick a wobblin’.
Enquirin’ for the rogue, They said my Connacht brogue,
Wasn’t much in vogue, On the rocky road to Dublin.From there I got away, My spirits never failin’
Landed on the quay As the ship was sailin’;
Captain at me roared, Said that no room had he,
When I jumped aboard, A cabin found for Paddy,
Down among the pigs I played some funny rigs,
Danced some hearty jigs, The water round me bubblin’,
When off Holyhead, I wished myself was dead,
Or better far instead, On the rocky road to Dublin.The boys of Liverpool, When we safely landed,
Called myself a fool; I could no longer stand it;
Blood began to boil, Temper I was losin’,
Poor ould Erin’s isle They began abusin’,
“Hurrah my soul,” sez I, My shillelagh I let fly;
Some Galway boys were by, Saw I was a hobble in,
Then with a loud hurray, They joined in the affray.

For we’re bound for Valaparaiser ’round the Horn! That day there wuz a great demand for sailors (for sailors),
For the Colonies and for ‘Frisco and for France (an’ for France),
So I shipped aboard a Limey barque the Hotspur (the Hotspur),
An’ got paralytic drunk on my advance (‘vance, ‘vance),Now I joined her on a cold December mornin’,
A-frappin’ o’ me flippers to keep me warm.
With the south cone a-hoisted as a warnin’,
To stand by the comin’ 0′ a storm.Now some of our fellers had bin drinkin’,
An’ I meself wuz heavy on the booze;
An’ I wuz on me ol’ sea-chest a-thinkin’
I’d turn into me bunk an’ have a snooze.I woke up in the mornin’ sick an’ sore,
An’ knew I wuz outward bound again;
When I heard a voice a-bawlin’ at the door,
‘Lay aft, men, an’ answer to yer names!’‘Twas on the quarterdeck where first I saw ’em,
Such an ugly bunch I’d niver seen afore;
For there wuz a bum an’ stiff from every quarter,
An’ it made me poor ol’ heart feel sick an’ sore.There wuz Spaniards an’ Dutchmen an’ Rooshians,
An’ Johnny Crapoos jist acrosst from France;
An’ most o’ ’em couldn’t speak a word o’ English,
But answered to the name of ‘Month’s Advance’.
I wisht I wuz in the ‘Jolly Sailor’,
Along with Irish Kate a-drinkin’ beer;
An’ then I thought what jolly chaps were sailors,
An’ with me flipper I wiped away a tear.I knew that in me box I had a bottle,
By the boardin’-master ’twas put there;
An’ I wanted something for to wet me throttle,
Somethin’ for to drive away dull care.So down upon me knees I went like thunder,
Put me hand into the bottom o’ the box,
An’ what wuz me great surprise an’ wonder,
Found only a bottle o’ medicine for the pox.I felt that I should skip an’ join another,
‘Twas plain that I had joined a lousy bitch;
But the chances wuz that I might join a worser,
An’ we might git through the voyage without a hitch.I axed the mate a-which a-watch wuz mine-O,
Sez he, ‘I’II soon pick out a-which is which’;
An’ he blowed me down an’ kicked me hard a-stern-O,
Callin’ me a lousy, dirty son-o’-a-bitch.Now we singled up an’ got the tugs alongside,
They towed us through the locks an’ out to sea;
With half the crew a-pukin’ o’er the ship’s side,
An’ the bloody fun that started sickened me.Although me poor ol’ head wuz all a-jumpin’,
We had to loose her rags the followin’ morn;
I dreamt the boardin’-master I wuz thumpin’,
When I found out he’d sent me around the Horn.I swore I would become a beachie-comber,
An’ niver go to sea no ruddy more;
For niver did I want to be a roamer ,
I’d shanghai the boardin’-master an’ stay ashore.But when we got to bully ol’ Vallaparaiser,
In the Bay we dropped our mud hook far from shore;
The ol’ Man he refused ter let us raise ‘er,
An’ he stopped the boardin’-masters comin’ aboard.I quickly made me mind up that I’d jump ‘er,
I’d leave the beggar an’ git a job ashore;
I swum across the Bay an’ went an’ left ‘er,
An’ in the English Bar I found a whore.But Jimmy the Wop he knew a thing or two, sir,
An’ soon he’d shipped me outward bound again;
On a Limey to the Chinchas for guanner, boys,
An’ soon was I a-roarin’ this refrain.So there wuz I once more again at sea, boys,
The same ol’ ruddy business over again;
Oh, stamp the caps’n round an’ make some noise, boys,
An’ sing again this dear ol’ sweet refrain."

To me, way hey, blow the man down
Now please pay attention and listen to me
Give me some time to blow the man downI’m a deep water sailor just come from Hong Kong
You give me some whiskey, I’ll sing you a songWhen a trim Black Ball liner’s preparing for sea
On a trim Black Ball liner I wasted me primeWhen a trim Black Ball liner preparing for sea
You’ll split your sides laughing such sights you would seeThere’s tinkers and tailors, shoemakers and all
They’re all shipped for sailors aboard the Black BallWhen a big Black Ball liner’s a-leaving her dock
The boys and the girls on the pier-head do flockNow, when the big liner, she’s clear of land
Our bosun he roars out the word of commandCome quickly, lay aft to the break of the poop
Or I’ll help you along with the toe of me bootPay attention to orders, now, you one and all
For see high above there flies the Black Ball‘Tis larboard and starboard, on deck you will sprawl
For kicking Jack Rogers commands the Black Ball"

And that’s the line where you can shine
Hurrah for the Black Ball LineThe Black Ball Ships are good and true
They are the ships for me and youFor once there was a Black Ball Ship
That fourteen knots an hour could clipThey’ll carry you along through frost and snow
And take you where the wind don’t blowYou will surely find a rich gold mine
Just take a trip in the Black Ball LineJust take a trip to Liverpool
To Liverpool, that Yankee schoolThe Yankee sailors you’ll see there
With red-top boots and short-cut hairAt Liverpool docks we bid adieu
To Poll and Bet and lovely SueAnd now we’re bound for New York Town
It’s there we’ll drink, and sorrow drown"

Fol de diddle rye raddy rye raddy   rye.Thought Jack to himself Now what can this be
But the finest old   whiskey from High Germany.
Smuggled up in a basket and sold on the sly
And   the name that it goes by is quare bungle rye raddy rye
Fol de diddle rye   raddy rye raddy ryeJack hands her a shilling and he thought nothing   strange
Says she Here hold the basket til I run for your change
Jack peeks   in the basket and a babe he did spy
Why be damned me says Jack this is quare   bungle rye raddy  rye
Fol de diddle rye raddy rye raddy ryeNow to get   the child christened was Jack’s first intent
So to get the child christened   to the parson he went.
Says the parson to Jack What’s the name he’ll go   by

Fol de   diddle rye raddy rye raddy rye.Says the parson to Jack That’s a mighty   quare name
