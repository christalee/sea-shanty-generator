0,The 23rd of February,"
On the 23rd of February,
The weather being clear.
We spied to be sure seven Turkish men-of-war,
Come a sailing from Algier.
Chorus:
To me ri fol leather ol,
ri fol leather ol,
ri fol leather ol lay.
Rol a diddle i,
rol a diddle i,
to me ri fol leather ol lay.

2. Well the very first ship to come alongside,
Was called the Green Pea.
We fired to her a warning shot,
And quickly she did flee.
Chorus:

3. Well the very next ship to come alongside,
Was called the Prince so clear.
Commanded by the big Bagsham,
Come a sailing from Algier.
Chorus:

4. Well the very next ship to come alongside,
Was called the Rose and Crown.
We fired our broadside into her,
And quickly she went down.
Chorus:

5. Well the very next ship to come alongside,
Was called the Harp and Lyre.
We fired our pitch buckets into her,
And quickly she took fire.
Chorus:

6. Well two we sunk and two we took,
The rest they ran away,
And one we brought to Englands shore,
Just to show we won the day.
Chorus:
"
1,A-Cruising We Will Go,"
Behold upon the swelling seas
With streaming pennants gay,
Our gallant ship invites the waves,
While glory leads the way.
Chorus:
: And a-cruising we will go, oho, oho, oho! :
And a-cruising we will go, ooooooho,
And a-cruising we will go!

2. You beauteous maids, your smiles bestow,
For if you prove unkind,
How can we hope to beat the foe?
We leave our hearts behind.
Chorus:

3. See Hardy's flage once more displayed,
Upon the deck he stands;
Britannia's glory ne'er can fade,
Or tarnish in his hands.
Chorus:

4. Britain to herself but true,
To France defiance hurled,
Give peace, America, with you,
And war with all the world.
Chorus:
"
2,"Abel Brown, the Sailor","
Oh, where am I goin' to sleep tonight?
Sez Abel Brown the sailor.
You can sleep upon a mat,
Cried the fair young maiden.
2. Oh, the mat is rough, an' my skin ain't tough,
Sez Abel Brown the sailor.
You can sleep upon the shelf,
Cried the fair young maiden.

3. What 'ave you got upon the shelf?
Sez Abel Brown the sailor.
I've got some rum upon the shelf,
Cried the fair young maiden.

4. Me throat is long, an' me thirst is strong,
Sez Abel Brown the sailor.
What if you roll from off the shelf?
Cried the fair young maiden.

5. I'll bounce on the floor an' ask for more,
Sez Abel Brown the sailor.
What if police should come to the house?
Cried the fair young maiden.

6. I'll take 'em on in two's or three's,
Sez Abel Brown the sailor.
Then I'll let you stay with me,
Cried the fair young maiden.

3,Abschied,"
Holder Jüngling, willst du fliehen,
Willst nicht länger sein bei mir,
In die Ferne willst du ziehen,
Sag, mein Schatz, was tat ich dir?
Hörst du nicht die Wellen rauschen?
Ihr Getöse macht mir Schmerz,
Die Gesänge der Matrosen,
Die zerreißen mir das Herz.

2. Denkst du noch an jene Stunde,
Da wir uns zuerst gesehn?
Liebe floß aus deinem Munde,
Damals warst du jung und schön.
Damals warst du froh und heiter,
Damals warst du nie betrübt,
Und jetzt willst du wieder weiter,
Fort von der, die dich geliebt.

3. Ach, du hast im Heimatlande
Eine andre, die dich liebt,
Die sich knüpft an unsre Bande,
Die dich heimlich zu sich zieht.
Zürnst du mir, dann muß ich weinen,
Denn du warst mein einzig Glück,
Nimm mich mit hin zu den Deinen,
Laß mich nicht allein zurück.

4. Als der Jüngling sich Morgen
Früh aus ihren Armen wand,
Frei von Kummer, frei von Sorgen,
Eilt er an den Meeresstrand.
Oh, ihr Wellen, schafft mir Frieden,
Oh, ihr Wellen, schafft mir Ruh',
Fort von der, die er betrogen,
Decken ihn die Fluten zu.

"
4,Across the Western Ocean,"
O, the times are hard and the wages low
Amelia, where you bound?
The Rocky Mountains is my home
Across the Western Ocean.

2. It's a land of plenty there you'll see
Amelia, where you bound?
I'm off across the Western Sea.
Across the Western Ocean.

3. To Liverpool I'll make my way
Amelia, where you bound?
To Liverpool that Yankee school.
Across the Western Ocean.

4. There's Liverpool Pat with his tarpaulin hat
Amelia, where you bound?
And Yankee John the packet rat.
Across the Western Ocean.

5. Beware those packet ships, I pray,
Amelia, where you bound?
They'll steal your stores and your clothes away.
Across the Western Ocean.

6. Wives and sweethearts don't you cry
Amelia, where you bound?
Sons and daughters wave goodbye
Across the Western Ocean.

7. Oh the jobs were bad and wages low
Amelia, where you bound?
The Rocky Mountains will be my new home
Across the Western Ocean.
"
5,Admiral Benbow,"
Come all ye seamen bold,
And draw near, and draw near
Come all ye seamen bold,
And draw near
It is of an admiral's fame
O brave Benbow was his name
How he fought all on the main
You shall hear, you shall hear.

2. Brave Benbow he set sail,
For to fight, for to fight
Brave Benbow he set sail,
For to fight.
Brave Benbow he set sail,
With a fine and pleasant gale
But his captains they turn'd tail
In a fright, in a fright.

3. Says Kirby unto Wade,
""We will run, we will run.""
Says Kirby unto Wade,
""We will run.
For I value no disgrace
Or the losing of my place
But the enemy I won't face
Nor his guns, nor his guns.""

4. Then Ruby and Benbow
Fought the French, fought the French,
Then Ruby and Benbow
Fought the French.
They fought them up and down
'Til the blood came trickling down
'Til the blood came trickling down
Where they lay, where they lay.

5. Brave Benbow lost his legs
By chain shot, by chain shot,
Brave Benbow lost his legs
By chain shot.
Brave Benbow lost his legs
And all on his stumps he begs
Fight on, my English lads
'Tis our lot, 'tis our lot.

6. The surgeon dress'd his wounds,
Cries Benbow, cries Benbow,
The surgeon dress'd his wounds,
Cries Benbow.
""Let a cradle now in haste
On the quarterdeck be placed,
That the enemy I may face
'Til I die, 'til I die.
"
6,Alabama,"
When the Alabama's keel was laid
Roll Alabama, roll
They laid her keel at Birkenhead
Oh, roll Alabama, roll

2. Oh, she was built in Birkenhead
Roll Alabama, roll
Built in the yard of Jonathan Laird
Oh, roll Alabama, roll

3. Away down the Mersey she rolled one day
Roll Alabama, roll
And across the ""Western"" she ploughed her way
Oh, roll Alabama, roll

4. With British guns, oh, she was stocked
Roll Alabama, roll
She sailed from Fayal, in Cherbourg she docked
Oh, roll Alabama, roll

5. To fight the north Semmes did employ
Roll Alabama, roll
Any method to kill and destroy
Oh, roll Alabama, roll

Awaiting was Winslow to start a good fight
Oh, roll Alabama, roll

Roll Alabama, roll
An Semmes escaped on a fine British yacht
Oh, roll Alabama, roll

8. The Kearsage wonAlabama so brave
Roll Alabama, roll
Sank to the bottom of a watery grave
Oh, roll Alabama, roll

9,All For Me Grog,"
Chorus:
Well it's all for me grog, me jolly jolly grog,
It's all for me beer and tobacco.
For I spent all me tin on the lassies drinking gin,
Far across the western ocean I must wander.

Where are me boots, me noggin', noggin' boots,
They're all gone for beer and tobacco.
For the heels they are worn out and the toes are kicked about
And the soles are looking out for better weather.
Chorus:

2. Where is me shirt, me noggin', noggin' shirt,
It's all gone for beer and tobacco,
For the collar is all worn, and the sleeves they are all torn,
And the tail is looking out for better weather.
Chorus:

3. I'm sick in the head and I haven't been to bed,
Since first I came ashore from me slumber,
For I spent all me dough on the lassies don't you know,
Far across the western ocean I must wander.
Chorus:
"
10,All Things Are Quite Silent,"
All things are quite silent, each mortal at rest,
When me and my love got snug in one nest,
When a bold set of ruffians they entered our cave,
And they forced my dear jewel to plough the salt wave.
2. I begged hard for my sailor as though I begged for life.
They'd not listen to me although a fond wife,
Saying: ""The king he wants sailors, to the sea he must go,""
And they've left me lamenting in sorrow and woe.

3. Through green fields and meadows we ofttimes did walk,
And sweet conversation of love we have talked,
With the birds in the woodland so sweetly did sing,
And the lovely thrushes' voices made the valleys to ring.

4. Although my love's gone I will not be cast down.
Who knows but my sailor may once more return?
And will make me amends for all trouble and strife,
And my true love and I might live happy for life.
"
11,The Amphitrite,"
Come all ye jolly sailors brave
That wear the jackets blue,
While I relate the dangers great
And hardships of the sea;
It's of a ship called the Amphitrite,
With a hundred and eight females,
With cargo and crew and passengers too,
Bound out for New South Wales.
2. It was on the eighteenth day of June,
From the city we set sail,
Leaving our friends behind us,
It grieved our hearts full sore.
And as we bore along the shore,
Till our friends got out of sight,
Saying, ""Adieu unto you blue-eyed girls
On board of the Amphitrite.""

3. About twelve o'clock on the third day,
We were all put to a stand,
When our goodly ship she ran aground,
All on a bank of sand;
And the children around their parents flocked
And tore their hair with fright,
For to think they must end their days
On board of the Amphitrite.

4. When our captain found he was aground,
Both anchors he let go,
Saying, ""Go reef your fore and main-top sails,
Or soon our fate we'll know!""
When our ship she gave one dreadful reel,
And soon went out of sight
And the shriek and cries would reach the skies,
On board of the Amphitrite.

5. All that reached the shore out of our crew
Were two poor lads and me;
We reached the shore all on a spar,
We swam the briny sea.
One was exhausted by the waves,
He died that very night;
That left only two out of our crew
On board of the Amphitrite.

6. Now the Amphitrite is lost and gone,
Both passengers and crew,
Besides thirty-five as brave sailor lads,
As ever wore jackets blue.
God grant relief to those poor souls,
And to those lamenting quite;
God grant relief to those poor souls
On board of the Amphitrite.
"
12,Anchors Aweigh,"
Stand Navy down the field,
Sails set to the sky.
We'll never change our course,
So Army you steer shy-y-y-y.
Roll up the score, Navy,
Anchors Aweigh.
Sail Navy down the field
And sink the Army, sink the Army Grey.

2. Get underway, Navy,
Decks cleared for the fray,
We'll hoist true Navy Blue
So Army down your Grey-y-y-y.
Full speed ahead, Navy;
Army heave to,
Furl Black and Grey and Gold
And hoist the Navy, hoist the Navy Blue

3. Blue of the Seven Seas;
Gold of God's great sun
Let these our colors be Till
All of time be done-n-n-ne,
By Severn shore we learn
Navy's stern call:
Faith, courage, service true
With honor over, honor over all.

Stand, Navy, out to sea,
Fight our battle cry;
We'll never change our course,
So vicious foe steer shy-y-y-y.
Roll out the TNT, Anchors Aweigh.
Sail on to victory
And sink their bones
To Davy Jones, hooray!

2. Anchors Aweigh, my boys,
Anchors Aweigh.
Farewell to college joys,
We sail at break of day-ay-ay-ay.
Through our last night on shore,
Drink to the foam,
Until we meet once more.
Here's wishing you a happy voyage home.
"
13,Andrew Rose,"
Andrew Rose, the British sailor
Now to you his woes I'll name
'Twas on the passage from Barbados
Whilst on board the Mary Jane.
Chorus:
Wasn't that most cruel usage
Without a friend to interpose?
How they've whipped and mangled,
Gagged and strangled
The British sailor, Andrew Rose.

2. 'Twas on the quarter-deck they laid him,
Gagged him with an iron bar;
Wasn't that most cruel usage
To put upon a British tar?
Chorus:

3. 'Twas up aloft the Captain sent him
Naked beneath the burning sun,
Whilst the mate did follow after,
Lashing him till the blood did run.
Chorus:

4. The captain gave him stuff to swallow;
Stuff to you I will not name,
Whilst the crew got sick with horror,
While on board the Mary Jane.
Chorus:

5. 'Twas in a water-cask they put him;
Seven long days they kept him there.
When loud for mercy Rose did venture,
The Captain swore no man should go there.
Chorus:

6. For twenty days they did ill-use him,
When into Liverpool they arrived.
The Judge he heard young Andrew's story;
""Captain Rodgers, you must die.""
Chorus:

7. Come all ye friends and near relations,
And all ye friends to interpose;
Never treat a British sailor
Like they did young Andrew Rose.
Chorus:
"
14,"Another of Seafarers, describing Evil Fortune","
What pen can well report the plight
Of those that travel on the seas?
To pass the weary winter's night,
With stormy clouds, wishing for day;
With waves that toss them to and fro,
Their poor estate is hard to show.

2. When boistering winds begin to blow
On cruel coasts, from haven we;
The foggy mist so dims the shore
That rocks and sands we may not see;
Nor have no room on seas to try,
But pray to God and yield to die.

3. When shoals and sandy banks appear
What pilot can direct his course?
When foaming tides draw us so near,
Alas! what fortune can be worse?
Then anchors hold must be our stay,
Or else we fall into decay.

4. We wander still from luff to lee,
And find no steadfast wind to blow;
We still remain in jeopardy,
Each perilous point is hard to show;
In time we hope to find redress,
That long have lived in heaviness.

5. O pinching, weary, loathsome life,
That travel still in far exile.
The dangers great on seas be rife,
Whose recompense doth yield but toil.
O Fortune, grant me my desire:
A happy end I do require.

6. When frets and spates have had their fill
And gentle calm the coast will clear,
Then haughty hearts shall have their will,
That long have wept with morning cheer;
And leave the seas with their annoy,
At home at ease to live in joy.
"
15,Around Cape Horn,"
Around Cape Horn we've got to go,
To me way, hay, o-hio!
Around Cape Horn to Calleao
A long time ago!

2. 'Round Cape Horn where the stiff winds blow,
To me way, hay, o-hio!
'Round Cape Horn where there's sleet and snow.
A long time ago!

3. I wish to God I'd never been born
To me way, hay, o-hio!
To drag my carcass around Cape Horn.
A long time ago!
"
16,The Arranmore Boat Song,"
With swelling sail, away, away!
Our bark goes bounding o'er the bay!
Farewell, farewell, old Arranmore!
She courtseys, courtseys to the shore.
Chorus:
Farewell, fond wives and children dear!
From ev'ry ill heav'n keep you clear;
Till through the surge we stagger back,
As full of fish as we can pack

2. For when we've sowed and gardened here,
Far off to other fields we'll steer;
Our farm upon the distant deep
Where all at once you till and reap.
Chorus:

3. There, there the reeling ridge we plough,
Our coulter keen the cutter's prow;
While fresh and fresh from out the trawl
The fish by hundreds in we haul.
Chorus:

4. Thou glorious sun, gleam on above
O'er Ara, Ara of our love.
Ye ocean airs, preserve her peace,
Ye night dews, yield her rich increase.
Chorus:

5. Until, one glitt'ring realm of grain,
She waves her wand'rers home again;
And we come heaping from our hold
A silver crop, beside the gold.
Chorus:
"
17,Auf einem Seemannsgrab,"
Ob Sturm uns bedroht hoch vom Norden,
Ob Heimweh im Herzen uns brennt;
Wir sind Kameraden geworden,
Und wenn es zur Hölle auch geht.
Matrosen die wissen zu sterben,
Wie immer das Schicksal auch spielt,
Und geht uns're Trommel in Scherben,
Dann singt uns der Nordwind ein Lied:
Refrain:
Auf einem Seemannsgrab, da blühen keine Rosen,
Auf einem Seemannsgrab, da blüht kein Blümelein,
: Der einz'ge Gruß, das sind die weißen Möwen
Und eine Träne die ein kleines Mädel weint. :

So manchen von uns sah'n wir sterben,
Doch keiner von uns hat geweint,
Scharfe Klippensie brachten Verderben,
Der Kahn ging zum Teufel derweil.
Es schlugen die eiskalten Wogen
Nach dem, den wir alle so geliebt;
Und als ihn der Tod von uns trennte,
Da sangen wir leis' dieses Lied:
Refrain:
"
18,"Away, Rio!","
The anchor is weighed and the sails they are set,
Away, Rio!
The maids we are leaving we'll never forget,

Chorus:
For we're bound for the Rio Grande,
And away, Rio! Aye, Rio!
We're bound away this very day,
For we're bound for the Rio Grande!

2. So it's pack up your donkey and get under way,
Away, Rio!
The girls we are leaving can take our half pay.
Chorus:

3. We've a jolly good ship and a jolly good crew,
Away, Rio!
A jolly good mate and a good skipper, too.
Chorus:

4. We'll sing as we heave to the maidens we leave,
Away, Rio!
And you who are listening, goodbye to you.
Chorus:

5. Sing good bye to Nellie and good bye to Sue
Away, Rio!
And you who are listening, good bye to you
Chorus:

6. And good-bye, fare you well, all you ladies of town
Away, Rio!
We've left you enough for to buy a silk gown
Chorus:

7. Now you Bowery ladies we'd have you to know
Away, Rio!
We're bound to the south'ard, O Lord, let us go!
Chorus:

8. Heave with a will and heave long and strong,
Away, Rio!
Sing the good chorus, for 'tis a good song.
Chorus:

9. Heave only one pawl, then 'vast heavin', belay!
Away, Rio!
Heave steady, because we say farewell today.
Chorus:

10. We'll sell our salt cod for molasses and rum
Away, Rio!
And get home again 'fore Thanksgiving has come
Chorus:

11. The chain's up and down, now the bosun did say,
Away, Rio!
Heave up to the hawsepipe, the anchor's aweigh.
Chorus:

12. Our good ship's a-going out over the bar
Away, Rio!
And we'll point her nose for the South-er-on Star
Chorus:

13. O say was you ever in Rio Grande?
Away, Rio!
O was you ever on that strand?
Chorus:
"
19,The Balena,"
On the noble fleet of whalers out sailing from Dundee,
Well manned by British sailors to work them on the sea;
On the western ocean passage none with them can compare
For there's not a ship could make the trip as the ""Balena"" I declare.
Refrain:
And the wind is on her quarter and her engine working free
And there's not another whaler a-sailing from Dundee
Can beat the aul' ""Balena"" and you needna try her on
For we challenge all both large and small from Dundee to St.Johns.

2. There's the new built ""Terra Nova"", she's a model with no doubt
There's the ""Arctic"" and ""Aurora"", you've heard so much about
There's Jacklin's model mail-boat, the terror of the sea
Couldn't beat the aul ""Balena"" boys, on a passage from Dundee.
Refrain:

3. And it happened on the Thursday four days after we left Dundee
Was carried off the quarter boats all in a raging sea
That took away our bulwark, our stanchions and our rails
And left the whole concern boys, a-floating in the gales.
Refrain:

4. Bold Jacklin carries canvas and fairly raises steam
And Captain Guy's a daring boy, goes ploughing through the stream
But Millan says the ""Eskimo"" could beat the bloomin' lot
But to beat the aul' ""Balena"" boys, they'd find it rather hot.
Refrain:

5. An' now that we've landed boys, where the rum is mighty cheap
We'll drink success to the Capt'n, for gettin' us o'er the deep
And a health to all our sweathearts, an' to our wives so fair
Not another ship could make that trip but the ""Balena"" I declare.
Refrain:
"
20,The Ballad of Captain Kidd,"
My name was William Kidd,
When I sailed, when I sailed,
My name was William Kidd,
When I sailed,
My name was William Kidd;
God's laws I did forbid,
And so wickedly I did,
When I sailed.
2. My parents taught me well,
When I sailed, when I sailed,
My parents taught me well,
When I sailed,
My parents taught me well,
To shun the gates of hell,
But against them I rebelled,
When I sailed.
3. I'd a Bible in my hand,
When I sailed, when I sailed,
I'd a Bible in my hand,
When I sailed,
I'd a Bible in my hand,
By my father's great command,
And I sunk it in the sand,
When I sailed.
4. I murdered William Moore,
As I sailed, as I sailed
I murdered William Moore,
As I sailed,
I murdered William Moore,
And laid him in his gore,
Not many leagues from shore,
As I sailed.
5. I was sick and nigh to death,
As I sailed, as I sailed
I was sick and nigh to death,
As I sailed,
I was sick and nigh to death,
And I vowed with every breath,
To walk in wisdom's ways,
When I sailed.
6. I thought I was undone,
As I sailed, as I sailed
I thought I was undone,
As I sailed,
I thought I was undone,
And my wicked glass had run,
But health did soon return,
As I sailed.
7. My repentance lasted not,
As I sailed, as I sailed
My repentance lasted not,
As I sailed,
My repentance lasted not,
My vows I soon forgot,
Damnation was my lot,
As I sailed.
8. I spied three ships from France,
As I sailed, as I sailed
I spied three ships from France,
As I sailed,
I spied three ships from France,
To them I did advance,
And took them all by chance,
As I sailed.
9. I spied three ships from Spain,
As I sailed, as I sailed
I spied three ships from Spain,
As I sailed,
I spied three ships from Spain,
I looted them for gain,
Till most of them were slain,
As I sailed.
10. I'd ninety bars of gold,
As I sailed, as I sailed
I'd ninety bars of gold,
As I sailed,
I'd ninety bars of gold,
And dollars manifold,
With riches uncontrolled,
As I sailed.
11. Thus being o'ertaken at last,
As I sailed, as I sailed
Thus being o'ertaken at last,
As I sailed,
Thus being o'ertaken at last,
And into prison cast,
And sentence being passed,
As I sailed.

12. Farewell, the raging main,
I must die, I must die,
Farewell, the raging main,
I must die,
Farewell, the raging main,
To Turkey, France, and Spain,
I shall never see you again,
For I must die.

13. To the Execution Dock,
I must go, I must go,
To the Execution Dock,
I must go,
To the Execution Dock,
While many thousands flock,
But I must bear the shock,
And must die.

14. Come all ye young and old,
And see me die, see me die,
Come all ye young and old,
And see me die,
Come all ye young and old,
You're welcome to my gold,
For by it I've lost my soul,
And must die.

15. Take a warning now by me,
For I must die, I must die,
Take a warning now by me,
For I must die,
Take a warning now by me,
And shun bad company,
Let you come to hell with me,
For I must die.

"
22,The Banks of Brandywine,"
One morning very early,
In the pleasant month of May
As I walked out to take the air,
All nature being gay;
The moon had not yet veiled her face,
But through the trees did shine
As I wandered forth to take the air
On the banks of Brandywine.
2. At such an early hour
I was surprised to see
A lovely maid with downcast eyes
Upon those banks so gay
I modestly saluted her,
She knew not my design
And requested her sweet company
On the banks of Brandywine.
3. ""I pray, young man, be civil,
My company forsake
For in my real opinion
I think you are a rake,
My love's a valiant sailor,
He's now gone to the Main
While comfortless I wander
On he banks of Brandywine.

4. ""My dear, why do you thus
Give up to melancholy cries?
I pray give up your weeping,
And dry those lovely eyes,
For sailors in each port, my dear,
They do a mistress find
He will leave you to wander
On the banks of Brandywine.""

5. ""O leave me, sir, do leave me!
Why do you me torment?
My Henry's wont to see me,
Therefore I am content.
Why do you thus torment me,
And cruelly combine
To fill my heart with horror
On the banks of Brandywine?""

6. ""I wish not to afflict your mind,
But rather for to ease
Such dreadful apprehensions,
They soon your heart will seize.
Your love, my dear, in wedlock bands,
Another one has joined.""
She swooned into my arms
On the banks of Brandywine.

7. The lofty hills and craggy rocks
Reechoed back her strains;
The pleasant groves and rural shades
Were witness to her pains.
""How often has he promised me
In Hymen's chains to join!
Now I'm a maid forsaken
On the banks of Brandywine.""

8. ""O no, my dear, that ne'er shall be.
Behold your Henry now!
I clasp you to my bosom, love,
I've not forgot our vow.
It's now I know you're true, my dear,
In Hymen's chains we'll join
And bless the happy morn we met
On the banks of Brandywine.""
"
23,The Banks of Newfoundland,"
You bully boys of Liverpool
I'll have you all beware
When you sail on them packet ships,
No dungaree jumpers wear
But have a big monkey jacket
All ready to your hand
For there blows some cold nor'westers
Off the banks of Newfoundland

Chorus:
We'll scrape her and we'll scrub her
With holy stone and sand
For there blows some cold nor'westers
On the banks of Newfoundland

2. We had Jack Lynch from Malnahinch,
Mike Murphy and some more
I tell you well, they suffered like hell
On the way to Baltimore
They pawned there gear in Liverpool
And sailed as they did stand
For there blow some cold nor'westers
On the banks of Newfoundland
Chorus:

3. Now the mate he stood on the fo'c'sle head
And loudly he did roar
Come rattle her in me lucky lads,
You're bound for America's shore
Come wipe the blood off that dead man's face
And haul or you'll be damned
For there blow some cold nor'westers
On the banks of Newfoundland
Chorus:

4. So now we're off the hook me boys,
And the land is white with snow
And soon we'll see the pay table
And we'll spend the whole night below
And on the docks, come down in flocks,
Those pretty girls will say
Ah, It's snugger with me than on the sea,
On the banks of Newfoundland
Chorus:
"
24,The Banks of Sweet Loch Ray,"
I am as poor a distressed maid
As ever yet was known.
By love I'm captivated
Which is proved my overthrow.
When herding out my father's flocks
By accidence did stray
It was there I met my sailor bold
On the banks of sweet Loch Ray.
2. ""Good morning to you, fair maid,"" he said,
With a heart so free
""And would you be contented
To go along with me?
I will dress you like Queen Helen
All in your Grecian style
And when we'll go to the town of Boyle
I will there make you my bride.""

3. With a modest blush this fair maid said,
""Your suit I must deny
For I am no way fitting
To be a sailor's bride.
Far from my native country
I am not inclined to stray
For my heart would break were I to leave
The banks of sweet Loch Ray.""

4. ""Fair maiden, I will not ask you
To leave your native place.
We will here set down and court awhile
All in this silent place,
We will set down and court awhile
Among the flowers so gay
And herd your sheep as they do feed
On the banks of sweet Loch Ray.""

5. Rolled up in the rapture of the night
The time stole slowly on.
My love has taken flight
And from me he has gone.
I'll never love a young man,
I never loved any young man half so well
And where to find my sailor bold
I'm sure I cannot tell.

6. My sailor bold he's gone from me
And he's crossed o'er the Main.
I mean for to live single
Until he returns again.
A crown of gold I would bestow
And at his feet I'd lay.
I'd bid adieu forevermore
To the banks of sweet Loch Ray.
"
25,Banks of the Nile,"
Farewell, my dearest Nancy,
Farewell I must away.
I hear the drums a-beating
And no longer I can stay.
For we're orders out of Portsmouth Town
And for many a long mile
For to fight the blacks and heathens
On the banks of the Nile.
2. Oh, I'll cut off my curly locks
And along with you I'll go
I'll dress meself in velveteen
And go and see Egypt, too.
I'll fight and bear thy banners well,
Kind fortune upon thee smile.
And we'll comfort one another
On the banks of the Nile.
3. Oh, your waist it is too slender, love,
And your waist it is too small.
I'm afraid that you won't answer me,
If l should on you call
Your delicate constitution will
Not stand the unwholesome soil.
Nor the dark, nor the sandy climate
On the banks of the Nile.
4. O Willie, dearest William.
Don't leave me here to mourn,
You'll make me curse and rue the day
For whenever I'd been born.
For the parting of my own true love
And the parting of me life
Now stay at home, dear William,
And I will be thee wife.
5. My curse upon the war
And the hour that it began
For it has robbed our counterie
Of many a gallant man
It took from us our old sweethearts,
Protectors of our soil
And their blood does steep the grass that's deep
On the banks of the Nile.
6. Let a hundred days be darkened
And let maidens give a sigh
It would melt the very elements
To hear the wounded cry
Let a hundred days be brightened
And let the maidens give a smile
But remember Abercrombie
On the banks of the Nile.
7. O now the war is over
And back I'll then return
Unto my wife and family
I'll leave behind to mourn.
We'll call them in around, me boys,
And there's no end of toil.
And no more we'll go a'roving
On the banks of the Nile.

27,The Bark Gay Head,"
Come all you young Americans
And listen to my ditty
It's all ahout a whaling bark
That left New Bedford City
The bark Gay Head it is her name
She's known both far and near
Her rules and regulations
They are most awful queer.

Chorus:
Cheer boys cheer
For the Gay Head and crew
For growling and soldiering
When there are things to do;
We never will, we never will,
We never can he high
We want three thousand barrels of oil,
Root hog or die.

2. The place this noble bark was built
Was Mattapoisett town
The workmen worked for a dollar a day
The boss was Jonathan Brown
She was launched upon July the tenth
At eight o'clock P.M.
And numerous crowds assembled round
To see them dump her down.
Chorus:

3. The Captain's name was Jenny
From Mattapoisett town
He walks upon the quarter-deck
And there you'll see him frown
He is the meanest captain
That ever you did see
He's crossed the Atlantic several times
From New Bedford to Africee.
Chorus:

4. We'll cheer my noble hearties
For the starboard boat and crew
Mr. Hazzard's their boat leader
He's a gentleman good and true
There's Hussy John and Taylor Dick
And a boatsteerer named Couch
And when they lower in their boat
They know what they're about.
Chorus:

5. And we will cheer my hearties
For the starboard boat and crew
For the blowing of their pulling
Which is something they can do
When they lower in their boat
They do the best they can
Ryder he's the biggest blower
And he's the smallest man.
Chorus:

6. We have the noble waist boat
Whose crew are very good
Their boatheader is a Dartmouth man
His name is Mister Wood.
And when they lower in their boat
They don't make any noise
But when you talk of pulling
They are the very boys.
Chorus:

7. We have another boat now
It's called the bow boat.
She's one of the jolliest crafts
That ever yet did float
Hiller pulls the bow oar
And Blankenship the stroke
Dexter pulls harpooner
And Jenny heads the boat.
Chorus:
"
28,Barnacle Bill,"
"":Who's that knocking at my door? :
Who's that knocking at my door?""
Said the fair young maiden.
It's only me from over the sea,
Says Barnacle Bill the Sailor.
My ass is tight, my temper's raw,
Says Barnacle Bill the Sailor.
I'm so wound up I'm afraid to stop,

A rag, a bone with a cherry on top,

I'm hard to windward and hard a-lee,
Says Barnacle Bill the Sailor.
I've newly come upon the shore,
And this is what I'm looking for,
A jade, a maid, or even a whore,
Says Barnacle Bill the Sailor.

3. : Oh, your whiskers scrape my cheeks, :
Oh, your whiskers scrape my cheeks,
Said the fair young maiden.
I'm dirty and lousy and full of fleas,
Says Barnacle Bill the Sailor
I'll stick my mast in whom I please,
Says Barnacle Bill the Sailor
My flowing whiskers give me class,
The sea horses ate them instead of grass,
If they hurt your cheeks, they'll tickle your ass,
Says Barnacle Bill the Sailor.

4. : Tell me that we'll soon be wed :
Tell me that we'll soon be wed
Said the fair young maiden.
You foolish girl, it's nothing but sport,
Says  Barnacle Bill the Sailor
I've got me a wife in every port,
Says Barnacle Bill the Sailor
Off I go on another tack
To give some other fair maid a crack,
But keep it oiled till I come back,
Says Barnacle Bill the Sailor.
 or
: Who's that knocking at my door? :
Who's that knocking at my door?
Said the fair young maiden
It's only me from over the sea,
Says Barnacle Bill the Sailor,
I'm all lit up like a Christmas tree,
Says Barnacle Bill the Sailor,
I've sailed the seas until I'm broke,
I drink and swear and gamble and smoke,
But I can't swim a bloody stroke,
Says Barnacle Bill the Sailor.

2. : Are you young and handsome, sir? :
Are you young and handsome, sir?
Said the fair young maiden.
I'm old and rough and ready and tough,
Says Barnacle Bill the Sailor,
I never can get drunk enough,
Says Barnacle Bill the Sailor,
I drinks my whisley when I can
Drinks it from an old tin pan,
For whiskey is the life of man,
Says Barnacle Bill the Sailor.

3. : I'll come down and let you in, :
I'll come down and let you in,
Said the fair young maiden.
Well hurry before I break the door,
Says Barnacle Bill the Sailor,
I'll rip and rave and rant and roar,
Says Barnacle Bill the Sailor,
I'll eat your cakes and I'll eat your pies,
I'll spin ye yarns and I'll tell ye lies,
I'll kiss your lips and I'll black your eyes,
Says Barnacle Bill the Sailor.

4. : Tell me when we'll meet again, :
Tell me when we'll meet again,
Said the fair young maiden.
Never again, we'll meet no more,
Says Barnacle Bill the Sailor.
Tonite I'm sailing from this shore,
Says Barnacle Bill the sailor.
And if you wait here till Kingdom Come,
Sittin' and waitin' and suckin' yer thumb,
You'll be waiting here till the day of yer doom,
Says Barnacle Bill the Sailor.

29,Barrett's Privateers,"
O the year was Seventenn Seventy-Eight
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
A letter of marque came from the king
To the scummiest vessel I've ever seen

Chorus:
God damn them all
I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears
Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier,
The last of Barrett's Privateers

2. O Elcid Barrett cried the town
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
For twenty brave men all fishermen who
Would make for him the Antelope's crew
Chorus:

3. The Antelope sloop was a sickening site
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
She'd list to the port and her sails in rags
And the cook in the scuppers with the staggers and jags
Chorus:

4. On the King's birthday we put to sea
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
Ninety-one days to Montego Bay
Pumping like madmen all the way
Chorus:

5. On the ninety-sixth day we sailed again
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
When a great big Yankee hove in sight
With our cracked four-pounders we made to fight
Chorus:

6. The Yankee lay low down with gold
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
She was broad and fat and loose in stays
But to catch her took the Antelope two whole days
Chorus:

7. Then at length she stood two cables away
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
Our cracked four-pounders made awful din
But with one fat ball the Yank stove us in
Chorus:

8. The Antelope shook and pitched on her side
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
Barrett was smashed like a bowl of eggs
And the main truck carried off both me legs
Chorus:

9. Now here I lay in my twenty-third year
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
It's been six years since we sailed away
And I just made Halifax yesterday
Chorus:
"
30,"The Bay of Biscay, Oh!","
Ye gentlemen of England
Who live home at your ease,
It's little do you think
Of the dangers of the seas;
When we receive our orders
We are obliged to go
On the Main to proud Spain
Where the stormy winds do blow.
2. Was on the fourth of August
From Spithead we set sail
With Ramely and Company
Blest with a pleasant gale;
We sailed along together
In the Bay of Biscay, Oh,
Where a dreadful storm it did arise
And the stormy wind did blow.
3. The Ramely she left us,
She could no longer stay
And by distress of weather
From us she bore away;
When she arrived at Gibralter
They told the people so
How they thought we were all lost
At the Bay of Biscay, Oh.
4. Kind heaven did protect her,
It was not quite so bad,
First we lost our foremast,
And then we lost our flag.
And then we lost our mainmast,
One of our guns also
And the men, we lost ten
On the Bay of Biscay, Oh.
5. When the mainmast started,
It gave a dreadful stroke,
In our starboard quarter,
A large hole did it broke.
Then the seas came battering in,
Our guns soon overflow
So boldly she plowed it
On the Bay of Biscay Oh.
6. The night being dark and dreary,
At twelve o'clock that night
Our captain in the forecastle
He was killed then outright.
The ring upon his finger
In pieces burst in two
There he laid until next day
When we overboard him threw.
7. The storm it being abated,
We rigged up jury mast
And steered it for Gibralter,
Where we arrived at last
They said it was a dismal sight
As ever they did know
We forced to drink wine
And drowned all our woe.

31,Bell Bottom Trousers,"
Chorus:
Singing bell bottom trousers,
Coat of navy-blue.
Let him climb the rigging
Like his daddy used to do.

Once there was a waitress
In the Prince George Hotel,
Her mistress was a lady
And her master was a swell.
Chorus:

2. They knew she was a simple girl
And lately from the farm.
And so they watched her carefully
To keep her from all harm.
Chorus:

3. The Forty Second Fusiliers
Came marching into town.
And with them came a complement
Of rapists of reknown.
Chorus:

4. They busted every maidenhead
That came within their spell.
But they never made the waitress
From the Prince George Hotel.
Chorus:

5. Next came a company
Of the Prince of Wales' Hussars
They piled into the whore house
And they packed along the bars.
Chorus:

6. Many a maid and mistress
And wife before them fell.
But they never made the waitress
From the Prince George Hotel.
Chorus:

7. One day there came a sailor.
Just an ordinary bloke.
A-bulging at the trousers.
With a heart of solid oak.
Chorus:

8. At sea without a woman
For seven years or more.
There wasn't any need to ask
What he was looking for.
Chorus:

9. He asked her for a candlestick
To light his way to bed.
He asked her for a pillow
To rest his weary head.
Chorus:

10. And speaking to her gently.
Just as if he meant no harm.
He asked her if she'd come to bed
Just so's to keep him warm.
Chorus:

11. She lifted up the blanket
And a moment there did lie.
He was on her; he was in her
In the twinkling of an eye.
Chorus:

12. He was out again, and in again,
And plowing up a storm.
And the only words she said to him:
""I hope you're keeping warm.""
Chorus:

13. Then early in the morning
The sailor he arose
Saying here's a two pound note.
My dear, for the damage I have done.
Chorus:

14. If you have a daughter,
Bounce her on your knee.
If you have a son,
Send the bastard out to sea.

7. Early in the morning the sailor lad arose
Saying, Here's a two pound note, my dear, for the damage I have caused
If you have a daughter, bounce 'er on your knee;
If you have a son, send the bastard out to sea!
Chorus:

8. Now she sits beside the dock, a baby on her knee
Waiting for the sailing ships a-comin' home from sea
Waiting for the jolly tars in navy uniforms
And all she wants to do, my boys, is keep the Navy warm!
Chorus:
"
32,Ben Backstay,"
Ben Backstay was our boatswain,
A very merry boy,
For no one half so merrily
Could pipe all hands ahoy,
And when unto his summons
We did not well attend,
No lad than he more merrily,
Could handle the rope's end.

Chorus:
: Sing chip chow, cherry chow,
Fol di riddle ido. :

2. While sailing once, our captain,
Who was a jolly dog,
Served out to all the company,
A double share of grog.
Ben Backstay he got tipsy,
All to his heart's content,
And he being half seas over,
Why overboard he went.
Chorus:

3. A shark was on the starboard bow,
Sharks don't on manners stand,
But grapple all they come near,
Just like your sharks on land.
We heaved Ben out some tackling
Of saving him some hope's,
But the shark had bit his head off,
So he couldn't see the ropes.
Chorus:

4. Without his head his ghost appeared
All on the briny lake;
He piped all hands ahoy and cried:
""Lads, warning by me take;
By drinking grog I lost my life,
So, lest my fate you meet,
Why, never mix your liquors, lads,
But always take them neat.""
Chorus:
"
33,The Bigler,"
On the Sunday morning, just at the hour of ten,
When the tug Mico Robert towed the schooner Bigler, through Lake Michigan.
O, there we made our canvas in the middle of the fleet,
And the wind hauled to the south'ard, boys, so we had to give her sheet.

Chorus:
Watch her, catch her, jump in her ju-baju,
Give her sheet and let her go,
The lads will pull her through.
And don't you hear her howling
When the wind was blowing free
On our down trip to Buffalo from Milwaukee.

2. The wind comes down from the south southeast; it blows both stiff and strong,
You'd ought to've seen that little schooner Bigler as she pulled out Lake Michigan.
O, far beyond her foaming bows, the fiery lights aflame,
With every stitch of canvas and her course was wing and wing.
Chorus:

3. Passing by the Proctors the wind was blowing free,
Sailing by the Beavers with the Skillaglee on our lea,
O, we hauled her in full and bye as close as she would lie,
And we weathered Waugoshance to enter the Straits of Mackinaw.
Chorus:

4. At Huron we made Presque Isle Light and then we tore away,
The wind it being fair, for the Isle of Thunder Bay.
Then the wind it shifted and the night it came on dark,
The captain kept a sharp lookout for the light at Point aux Barques.
Chorus:

5. We passed the light and kept in sight of Michigan north shore,
A-boomin' for the river as we'd often done before,
When just abreast of Port Huron Light, both anchors we let go,
And the Sweepstake came 'longside and took the Bigler in tow
Chorus:

6. She took the seven of us in tow, all of us fore and aft,
She towed us down to Lake St. Clare and stuck us on the flat.
Then eased the Hunter's tow line to give us all relief,
The Bigler fell astern and went into a boat called the Maple Leaf.
Chorus:

7. And then the Sweepstake towed us out beyond the river light,
Lake Erie for to roam and the blustering winds to fight,
The wind being from the south'ard, it blew a pretty gale,
And we took it as it came for we could not carry sail.
Chorus:

8. We made the Eau and passed Long Point, the wind now blowing free,
We bowled along the Canada shore, Port Colborne on our lee,
What is that that looms ahead? We knew as we drew near,
That blazing like a star, shone the light on Buffalo Pier.
Chorus:

9. And now we're safely moored in the Buffalo Creek at last,
And under Brigg's elevator the Bigler is made fast.
And in some lager beer saloon we'll let the bottle pass,
For we're all happy shipmates and we like a social glass.
Chorus:
"
34,Blackbird,"
I am a young sailor,
My story is sad
Though once I was carefree,
And a brave sailor lad
I courted a lassie,
By night, and by day
But now, she has left me,
And sailed far away.

Chorus:
Oh if I was a blackbird,
And could whistle and sing
I'd follow the vessel,
My true love sails in
And in that top riggin',
I would there build my nest
And I'd flutter my wings
O'er her lily white breast.

2. Or if I was a scholar,
And could handle the pen
One secret love-letter,
To my true love I'd send
And tell of my sorrow,
My grief and my pain
Since she's gone and left me,
In yon floating land
Chorus:

3. I've sailed on the ocean,
My fortune to seek
Oh, I miss her caress,
And her kiss on my cheek
I returned and I told her,
My love was still warm
But she turned away lightly,
And great was her scorn
Chorus:

4. I offered to take her,
To Donneybrooke fair
And to buy her fine ribbons,
To tie up her hair
I offered to marry,
And stay by her side
But she says in the morning,
She sails with the tide
Chorus:

5. My parents, they chide me,
They will not agree
Saying that me and my false-love,
Married shouldn't never be
Ah, but let them deprive me,
And do what they will
While there's breath in my body,
She's the one I love still
Chorus:
"

To me, way hey, blow the man down
Our bosun he roars out the word of command
O, give me some time to blow the man down

8. Come quickly, lay aft to the break of the poop
To me, way hey, blow the man down
Or I'll help you along with the toe of me boot
O, give me some time to blow the man down

9. Pay attention to orders, now, you one and all
To me, way hey, blow the man down
For see high above there flies the Black Ball
O, give me some time to blow the man down

10. 'Tis larboard and starboard, on deck you will sprawl
To me, way hey, blow the man down
For kicking Jack Rogers commands the Black Ball
O, give me some time to blow the man down
"
36,Black Susie,"
For once I joined a Liverpool ship,
O roll the cotton down!
We had ord'r to go to New Orleans,
O roll the cotton down!

2. There it was, where I first saw a niggerwench,
O roll the cotton down!
Her name was Sue and was liked by the crew,
O roll the cotton down!

3. And dark-eyed Susie came on board,
O roll the cotton down!
And she said to the captain: how do you do?
O roll the cotton down!

4. And up aloft his chronometer flew,
O roll the cotton down!
And she winked with her eyes to the chief mate too,
O roll the cotton down!

5. I think I heard the captain say:
O roll the cotton down!
Another pool and then belay!
O roll the cotton down!

40,"Blow, Ye Winds","
'Tis advertised in Boston,
New York and Buffalo,
Five hundred brave Americans,
A-whaling for to go, singing,
Chorus:
Blow, ye winds in the morning,
And blow, ye winds, high-o!
Clear away your running gear,
And blow, ye winds, high-o!

2. They send you to New Bedford,
That famous whaling port,
And give you some land-sharks
To board and fit you out.
Chorus:

3. They send you to a boarding house,
There for a time to dwell;
The thieves they there are thicker
Than the other side of hell!
Chorus:

4. They tell you of the clipper ships
A-going in and out,
And say you'll take five hundred sperm
Before you're six months out.
Chorus:

5. It's now we're out to sea, my boys,
The wind comes on to blow;
One half the watch is sick on deck,
The other half below.
Chorus:

6. But as for the provisions,
We don't get half enough;
A little piece of stinking beef
And a blamed small bag of duff.
Chorus:

7. Now comes that damned old compass,
It will grieve your heart full sore.
For theirs is two and thirty points
And we have forty four.
Chorus:

8. Next comes the running rigging,
Which you're all supposed to know;
'Tis ""Lay aloft, you son of a gun,
Or overboard you go!""
Chorus:

9. The coopers's at the vise bench,
A-making iron poles,
And the mate's upon the main hatch
A-cursing all our souls.
Chorus:

10. The Skipper's on the quarterdeck
A-squinting at the sails,
When up aloft the lookout sights
A school of whales.
Chorus:

11. ""Now clear away the boats, my boys,
And after him we'll travel,
But if you get too near his fluke,
He'll kick you to the devil!""
Chorus:

12. Now we have got him turned up,
We tow him alongside;
We over with our blubber hooks,
And rob him of his hide.
Chorus:

13. Now the boat steerer overside
The tackle overhauls,
The Skipper's in the main-chains,
So loudly does he bawl!
Chorus:

14. Next comes the stowing down, my boys,
'Twill take both night and day,
And you'll all have fifty cents apiece
On the hundred and ninetieth lay.
Chorus:

15. Now we are bound into Tonbas,
That blasted whaling port,
And if you run away, my boys,
You surely will get caught.
Chorus:

16. Now we are bound into Tuckoona,
Full more in their power,
Where the skippers can buy the Consul up
For half a barrel of flour!
Chorus:

17. But now that our old ship is full
And we don't give a damn,
We'll bend on all our stu'nsails
And sail for Yankee land.
Chorus:

18. When we get home, our ship made fast,
And we get through our sailing,
A winding glass around we'll pass
And damn this blubber whaling!
Chorus:
"
41,Bold Dighton,"
Come all you bold heroes that plough the rough main,
Give ear to our story, the truth I'll explain.
It was our misfortune which happened in great war,
And how we escaped from the French at Bastar.
2. We were then confined on the Guadaloupe shore,
Of true valiant seamen four hundred or more,
Shut up in a small compass being greatly distressed,
With painful disease and famine oppressed.
3. A gallant young hero, from Saint Lucia he came,
Both generous and wealthy, called Dighton by name.
He had the heart of a lion, the soul of a prince,
And friends's kind impulse to us did evince.
4. He came to our prison, he mourned our sad fate,
He launched out his gold to relieve our sad state.
Five hundred bright guineas he gave, I am sure,
Which did greatly relieve us in this distressed hour.
5. At this generous action the French did complain.
They soon did confine him with fetters and chains
With us in the prison, it was them we might see,
But from his chains and fetters we soon set him free.
6. Says Dighton, ""My boys, if you'll take my advice,
Now if you'll prove constant it is done in a trice.
For 'tis down by yon pier the Tyger does lay,
A stout and fine coaster, she is fit for the sea.

7. ""The captain's on shore and we have all things on board,
A plenty of cannons, pikes, pistols, and swords.
Now if you will prove constant and stand by my side,
We will board her, my boys, and we will sail the next tide.""

8. Then at this adventure we all did agree,
Each breast loaded with ardor to fight and be free.
""Come give us your signal,"" each sailor replied,
""We are ready to conquer, or die by your side.""

9. ""Prepare for the conflict, no longer delay.
But keep yourselves cool, boys, my orders obey.""
Three gallant young seamen as seconds he chose.
Our signal for freedom was, ""Death to our foes!""

10. Then out of prison we all rushed amain.
The three guns were fired, the French guards were slain.
On board of the Tiger we soon rushed our way.
We cut both her cables and stood out to sea.

11. Which caused a sad rumpus, it being midnight.
The Frenchmen bawled out in a terrible fright,
""Mon Dieu, fracter engie!"" Drums beat and bells toll,
Our hero shouts, ""Freedom!"" to each valiant soul.

12. Their fortress was open, their cannon did play,
Their shot flew iike hail as we got under way.
They shattered our spars as we sailed from the shore.
To bid them good-bye we a broadside let pour.

13. Then out of all danger we thought ourselves clear,
But for this mistake we did pay very dear.
Next morning at dayiight it was there we espied
The Lion, a corvette, hang down on our side.

14. She plied us with grapeshot with broadside so sore,
Which caused the Tiger to make her guns roar.
With thirty-six eighteens the Lion did growl,
And eighteen brass nines the fierce Tiger did bowl.

15. Yard-arms and broadsides, for three glasses we lay,
At length our broadside cut her mainmast away.
Says Dighton, ""My boys, if you are tired of this fun
You now have your choice, to fight or to run!""

16. To spare blood and slaughter the crew did incline.
To run down the corvette it was our design.
But at this same moment she grappled us fierce,
And then sword in hand was our only resource.

17. To board and to slaughter they were fully bent.
To give us no quarters was their sole intent.
To board us thrice over they tried with this view,
But they were repulsed by the Tiger's bold crew.

18. Then Dighton cried out as each hero should feel,
Whose eyes transferred fury like bright burnished steel,
""There is death to each man on the point of my sword.
Come all my bold heroes, let us jump overboard!""

19. Then over the bulwark he jumped like a roe.
One stroke from his sabre laid two Frenchmen low.
On board of the corvette we all rushed so fierce
That soon from their quarters the French did disperse.

20. Steel sparkle, pikes rattle, and swords loudly clash,
And the blood on her decks like salt water did dash.
Her scuppers with huge streams of crimson did pour,
And the blue seas all round us rolled purple with gore.

21. Three hundred brave seamen were slain of their crew,
When the Frenchmen gave out and they cried, ""Mon Dieu!""
They fell on their knees and their weapons let fall,
And then our bold hero for quarter did call.

22. We soon gave them quarter and then we did hear
That for to engage us they did volunteer.
They trebled our metal with e'en two for one,
But Fortune's kind favor saved Freedom's bold son.

23. Then Dighton cried out, ""Now the battle is o'er,
Let the French learn this lesson and teach it on shore,
Go back to their country and friends and take care
To treat well in future each prisoner of war!""

24. To conduct the French back we the Tiger then gave,
Our seamen were generous and valiant and brave;
Then down to Antigua with our corvette we bore,
And on the next morning we all jumped ashore.

25. Drink a health to each seaman that ploughs the rough main.
May each, crowned with laurels, return home again.
May the fair of our country some gratitude show
To the sons of the ocean that fight the proud foe.

26. And as for brave Dighton, our true valiant friend,
May glories pursue him while honors attend,
And when he does die may each seaman draw near,
Come kneel at his tombstone and let fall a tear.
"
42,The Bold Princess Royal,"
On the fourteenth of February we sailed from the land
In the bold Princess Royal bound for Newfoundland
We had forty bright seamen our ship’s company
So boldly from the Eastward to the Westward bore we.

2. We had not been sailing scarce days two or three
When a man from our topmast a sail he did see
Come bearing down on us to see where we bore
And under her mizzen black colours she bore.

3. Great God cried our captain what shall we do now
Here comes a bold pirate to rob us I know
Oh no cried our chief mate that shall not be so
We will shake out our reef me boys and away from him we’ll go.

4. It was the next morning at the dawning of the day
This lofty large pirate shot under our lee
Whence came you cried the pirate we answered him so
We are out of fair London bound for Callao.

5. Then back your main topsails and heave your ship to
For I have a letter to send down to you
If I back may topsail and heave my ship to
It will be for some pilot and not alongside you.

6. He chased us to the Eastward all that livelong day
He chased us to the Westward but he couldn't make no way
He fired some shots after us but none did prevail
And the bold Princess Royal soon showed him her tail.

7. Oh now cried our captain the pirate is gone
Go down for your grog boys go down every one
Go down for your grog boys and be of good cheer
For while we’ve got sea room bold lads never fear.
"
43,Bold Riley,"
Our anchor's aweigh and our sails are all set,

By Whitestocking time, you'll be drinking hot rum.
Bold Riley-oh, gone away!

3. The rain it is raining now all the day long,
Bold Riley-oh, boom-a- lay!
And the northerly wind, it does blow so strong.
Bold Riley-oh, gone away!
Chorus:

4. We're outward and bound for Bengal bay,
Bold Riley-oh, boom-a- lay!
Get bendin', me boys, it's a hell of a way.
Bold Riley-oh, gone away!

45,The Bonnie Ship the Diamond,"
The Diamond is a ship me lads,
For the Davis Straits she's bound
And the Quay it is all garnished
With bonnie lassies round
Captain Thompson gives the order
To sail the ocean wide
Where the sun it never sets me lads
Nor darkness dims the sky.

Chorus:
And it's cheer up, me lads
Let your hearts never fail,
For the bonnie ship The Diamond
Goes a-fishing for the whale!

2. Along the quay at Peterhead
The lassies stand around
Wi' their shawls all pulled about them
And the salt tears runnin' down
Oh don't you weep, my bonnie lass,
Though you be left behind
For the rose will grow on Greenland's ice
Before we change our mind.
Chorus:

3. Here's a health to The Resolution,
Likewise the Eliza Swan
Here's a health to the Battler of Montrose
And The Diamond ship of fame

And the jackets of the blue

We'll hae sweethearts enoo.

When the Greenland lads come hame
Wi' a ship that's fu' o' oil me lads

And the blankets for to tear
And every lass in Peterhead
Sing hushabye my dear!

46,Boston Harbor,"
From Boston harbor we set sail
And the wind was blowin' the devil of a gale
With the ring-tail set all about the mizzen peak
And the dolphin striker plowin' up the deep
Chorus:
With a big bow wow, tow row row
Fal dee rall dee di do day.

2. The up steps the skipper from down below
And he looks aloft, boys, and he looks alow
And he looks alow and he looks aloft
And it's tighten up your ropes, boys, fore and aft.
Chorus:

3. Then it's down to his cabin he quickly falls
To his poor old steward then he bawls
""Fix me a glass that will make me cough
'Cause it's better weather here than it is up aloft.""
Chorus:

4. While it's we poor seamen that are up on the decks
With the blasted rain falling down our necks
And not a drop of grog will he afford
For he damns our eyes with every other word.
Chorus:

5. Now there's just one thing we all do crave
That he will find a watery grave
We will heave him down into some dark hole
Where the sharks'll have his body and the Devil have his soul.
Chorus:

6. Now the old bugger is dead and gone
And damn his eyes, he's left a son
And if to us he doesn't prove frank
We'll very soon make him walk the plank.
Chorus:
"
47,Botany Bay,"
Come all ye young men of learning,
And a warning take from me,

And shun bad company,
I would have you quit night walking,
Or else you'll rue the day,
You'll rue your transportation, lads,
When you're bound for Botany Bay
2. I was brought up in London town,
At a place I know full well,
Brought up by honest parents,
For the truth to tell.
Brought up by honest parents,
And reared most tenderly,
Till I became a roving blade,
Which proved my destiny.
3. My character was shaken,
And I was sent to jail.
My friends they tried to clear me,
But nothing could prevail.
At the old Bailey sessions,
The judge to me did say:
The jury found you guilty, lad,
So you go to Botany Bay.
4. It was on May the twenty eight,
From England we did steer,
And all things being safe on board,
We sailed down the river clear.
And every ship that we passed by,
We heard the sailors say:
Good thing it's them not us, ho! ho!
That are bound for Botany Bay.
5. There is a girl in Manchester,
A girl I know quite well,
And if I ever get set free,
With her I intend to dwell.
Which means, I mean to marry her,
And no more go astray,
I'll shun all evil company,
Bid adieu to Botany Bay.

Et sans rien dire, et en pleurant,
Il a rejoint son bâtiment.

"
49,British Man O' War,"
It was down in yonder meadow,
I carelessly did stray,
There I beheld a lady fair,
All with a sailor gay,
He said, My lovely fair maid,
I soon must leave this shore,
To cross the briny ocean
In a British Man-of-War.
2. Fair Susan fell to weeping,
Young sailor"" she did say,
Oh do not be so venturesome,
As to throw your life away,
For when that I am twenty-one
I shall receive my store,
So I pray you do not venture
On a British Man-of-War.

3. Oh, Susan lovely Susan,
The truth to you I'll tell,
The British Flag insulted is,
All England knows it well,
I may be crowned with laurels,
All like some jolly tar,
So I'll face the walls of China
In a British Man-of-War.

4. Oh do not be so venturesome
As to face the cruel Chinese,
For they will prove as treacherous
As any Portugese,
And by some deadly dagger,
You may receive a scar,
So William do not venture
On a British Man-of-War.

5. Oh Susan lovely Susan,
The time will quickly pass.
Will you come to the Ferry-House
To take a parting glass?
For my ship-mates they are ready,
To row me from the shore,
And I'll fight for Englands' glory,
In a British Man-of-War.

6. Then he took out his handkerchief
And he tore it clean in two,
Saying, Take this dearest Susan
And I'll do the same by you.
When the bullets they surround me
And the cannons they do roar,
I'll fight for Fame and Susan
On a British Man-of-War.

56,The Chivalrous Shark,"
The most chivalrous fish in the ocean,
To the ladies forbearing and mild,
Though his record be dark,
The man-eating shark
Will eat neither woman nor child.
2. He dines upon seamen and skippers,
And tourists his hunger assuage
And a fresh cabin boy
Will inspire him with joy,
If he's past the maturity age.
3. A doctor, a lawyer, a preacher,
He'll gobble one any fine day.
But the ladies, God bless 'em,
He'll only address 'em
Politely and go on his way.
4. I can readily cite you an instance
Where a lovely young lady of Bream;
Who was tender and sweet
And delicious to eat,
Fell into the bay with a scream.
5. She struggled and flounced in the water
And signaled in vain for her bark.
And she'd surely been drowned
If she hadn't been found
By a chivalrous, man-eating shark.
6. He bowed in a manner most polished,
Thus soothing her impulses wild.
""Don't be frightened,"" he said,
""I've been properly bred,
And will eat neither woman nor child.""

7. He proffered his fin and she took it,
Such gallantry none can dispute,
While the passengers cheered
As the vessel they neared,
And a broadside was fired in salute.

8. They soon stood alongside the vessel,
While a lifesaving dinghy was low'r'd.
With the pick of the crew
And her relatives few,
And the mate and the skipper aboard.

9. They hauled her aboard in a jiffy,
While the shark stood attention the while.
Then he raised on his flipper,
And ate up the skipper,
And went on his way with a smile.

10. Now this shows that the prince of the ocean,
To the ladies forbearing and mild,
Though his record be dark,
The man-eating shark
Will eat neither woman nor child.

If they were sometimes in our place

4. When speaking of a man ashore
We never hear you say

Be his calling what it may
Be he a travelling tinker,
Or a scavanger, or a sweep
Then why call us common sailors
Who battle with the deep

"
62,The Constitution and the Guerrière,"
It ofttimes has been told,
That the British seaman bold
Could flog the tars of France
So neat and handy, oh!
But they never found their match,
Till the Yankees did them catch,
O, the Yankee boys for fighting
Are the dandy, oh!
2. The Guerrière, a frigate bold,
On the foaming ocean rolled,
Command by Proud Dacres
The grandee, oh!
With as choice an English crew,
As a rammer ever drew,
Could flog the Frenchmen two
To one so handy, oh!

3. When this frigate hove in view,
Says proud Dacres to his crew,
""Come, clear ship for action
And be handy, oh!
To the weather gage, boys, get her,""
And to make his men fight better,
Gave them to drink, gunpowder
Mixed with brandy, oh!

4. Then Dacres loudly cries,
""Make this Yankee ship your prize,
You can in thirty minutes,
Neat and handy, oh!
Twenty-five's enough I'm sure,
And if you'll do it in a score,
I'll treat you to a double
Share of brandy, oh!

5. The British shot flew hot,
Which the Yankee answered not,
Till they got within the distance
They called handy, oh!
""Now,"" says Hull unto his crew,
""Boys, let's see what we can do,
If we take this boasting Briton
We're the dandy, oh!

6. The first broadside we poured
Carried her mainmast by the board,
Which made this lofty frigate
Look abandoned, oh!
The Dacres shook his head,
And to his officers said,
""Lord! I didn't think those Yankees
Were so handy, oh!

7. Our second told so well,
That their fore and mizzen fell,
Which dous'd the royal ensign
Neat and handy, oh!
""By George,"" says he, ""we're done,""
And they fired a lee gun,
While the Yankees struck up
Yankee Doodle Dandy, oh!

8. Then Dacres came on board,
To deliver up his sword,
Tho' loath he was to part with it,
It was so handy, oh!
""O, keep your sword,"" says Hull,
""For it only makes you dull,
Cheer up and let us have
A little brandy, oh!&quot
"
63,The Cumberland and the Merrimac,"
Come all my jolly seamen,
Likewise you landsmen too.
It is a dreadful story
I will unfold to you.
It's all about the Cumberland,
The ship so true and brave
And it's many the loyal seamen
That met a wat'ry grave.
2. It was early in the morning,
Just at the break of day,
When our good ship the Cumberland
Lay anchored in the bay,
When the man from on the lookout
Down to the rest did say:
""There is something like a housetop,
To the larboard she does lay.""

3. Then our captain took his telescope,
And he gazed far o'er the blue.
Turning 'round he said as follows
To his brave and loyal crew:
""That thing you see over yonder
Jjust like a turtle's back,
Is that cursed Rebel steamer
They call the Merrimac!""

4. Then our decks were cleared for action,
Each gun was pointed true,
But still that Rebel steamer
Came steaming o'er the blue;
And on she kept a-coming
Till no distance did us part,
When she sent a ball a-humming
That stilled the beat of many's the heart.

5. In vain we poured our broadsides
Into her ribs of steel,
But still no breach was in her,
No damage did she feel.
Up stepped the Rebel commander,
In a voice of thunder spoke,
""Pull down your flying colors,
Or I'll sink your Yankee boat!""

6. Then our captain's eyes did glisten,
His face grew pale with rage,
And in a voice of thunder
To the Rebel commander said,
""My crew is brave and loyal,
And by me they will stand,
And before I'll strike my colors
You can sink me an be damned!""

7. Then this ironclad she left us
A hundred yards or more,
The screeching and screaming of her balls
Our wooden sides she tore.
She struck us right amidships,
Her ram went crashing through,
And the waters they came pouring in
On the brave and loyal crew.

8. Then our captain turned unto his men
And unto them did say,
""I'll not leave the Cumberland
While she does ride the wave,
It's you, my loyal comrades,
May seek your lives to save,
But I'll go down with my gallant ship
For to meet a watery grave.

9. They swore that they'd not leave her,
And manned the guns afresh,
And broadside after broadside poured,
Till the waters reached their breasts.
And as they down went sinking,
Down in the briny deep,
The Stars and Stripes still floated
From the maintop's highest peak!
"
64,The Dark-Eyed Sailor,"
As I rov'd out one ev'ning fair
It being in the summertime to take the air
I spied a sailor and a lady gay
: And I stood listen :
To hear what they would say.
2. He said ""Fair lady, why do you roam
For the day it is spent and the night is on.""
She heaved a sigh, while the tears did roll
: ""For my dark-eyed sailor, :
So young and stout and bold.

3. ""'Tis seven long years since he left the land,
A ring he took from off his lily-white hand
One half of the ring is still here with me,
: But the other's rolling, :
At the bottom of the sea.""

4. He said, ""Ye may drive him out of your mind,
Some other young man you'll surely find;
Love turns aside and soon cold does grow,
: Like a winter's morning, :
The hills all white with snow.""

5. She said, ""I'll never forsake my dear,
Although we're parted this many a year.
Genteel he was and rake like you,
: To induce a maiden, :
To slight the jacket blue.""

6. One half of the ring did young William show,
She ran distracted in grief and woe,
Saying, ""William, William, I have gold in store
: For my dark-eyed sailor, :
Has proved his overthrow.""

7. There is a cottage by yonder lea,
This couple's married and does agree;
So maids be loyal when your love's at sea,
: For a cloudy morning, :
Brings in a sunny day.

4. Dat Soltfleesch weur gröön,
Un de Speck weur vull Moden.
Kööm gev dat blots an
Wiehnachtsobend.
Refrain:

5. Un wulln wi mol seiln,
Ick segg dat ja nur,
Denn lööp he dree vörut
Und veer wedder retur.
Refrain:

6. As dat Schipp, so weer
Ok de Kaptein,
De Lüd für dat Schipp weern
Ok blots schangheit.
Refrain:
"
68,The Dogger Bank,"
Sailing over the Dogger Bank,
Wasn't it a treat?
The wind a-blowing 'bout east-nor'east,
So we had to give her sheet;
You ought to see us rally,
The wind a-blowing free,
On passage from the Dogger Bank
To Great Grimsby.

Chorus:
So watch her, trigger,
The proper ju-ber-ju,
Give her sheet and let her rip,
We're the boys to pull her through,
You ought to have seen us rally,
The wind a-blowing free,
On passage from the Dogger Bank
To Great Grimsby.

2. Now our captain he's a shang-a-roosh,
He likes a drop of good ale,
Our mate he's a roadstone-prat-inspector,
He's been seen in many a goal;
Our third hand he's a bushranger,
He come on deck and received the mail,
And you give a look at our old cook,
He's so hoppity wild.
Chorus:

3. Now we are the boys to make a noise
When we come home from sea,
We get right drunk and roll on the floor
And cause a jubilee;
We get right drunk and full of beer,
We roll all over the floor,
And when our rent it is all spent,
We'll go to sea for more.
Chorus:
"
69,The Dreadnought,"
There's a flash packet, a flash packet of fame,
She belongs to New York and the Dreadnought's her name;
She's bound to the westward where the strong winds blow,
Bound away in the Dreadnought, to the westward we go.
2. The time for her sailing is now drawing nigh,
Farewell, pretty May, I must bid you goodbye,
Farewell to old England and all we hold dear,
Bound away in the Dreadnought, to the westward we'll steer.
3. O, the Dreadnought is pulling out of Waterloo Dock,
Where the boys and the girls to the pierheads do flock;
They will give us three cheers while their tears do flow,
Saying, ""God bless the Dreadnought, where'er she may go!""

4. O, the Dreadnought is waiting in the Mersey so free,
Waiting for the Independence to tow her to sea;
For around that Rock Light where the Mersey does flow,
Bound away in the Dreadnought, to the westward we'll go.

5. O, the Dreadnought's a-bowlin' down the wild Irish Sea,
Where the passengers are merry, their hearts full of glee,
While her sailors like lions walk the decks to and fro,
She's the Liverpool packet, O Lord, let her go!

6. O, the Dreadnought's a-sailin' the Atlantic so wide,
While the dark, heavy seas roll along her black sides,
With her sails neatly spread and the red cross to show,
She's the Liverpool packet, O Lord, let her go!

7. O, the Dreadnought's becalmed on the banks of Newfoundland,
Where the water's so green and the bottom is sand;
Where the fish of the ocean swim round to and fro,
She's the Liverpool packet, O Lord, let her go!

8. O, the Dreadnought's arrived in America once more,
Let's go ashore, shipmates, on the land we adore,
With wives and sweethearts so happy we'll be,
Drink a health to the Dreadnought, wherever she be.

9. Here's a health to the Dreadnought, to all her brave crew,
Here's a health to her captain, and her officers, too,
Talk about your flash packets, Swallowtail and Black Ball,
Then, here's to the Dreadnought, the packet to beat them all.
"
70,A Drop of Brandy-O,"
A landlady of France loved an officer, 'tis said
And the officer he dearly loved his brandy-o.
Now said she ""I dearly love this officer, tho' his nose is red
And his legs are what the regiment calls bandy-o.

2. But when this bandy officer was ordered to the coast,
Then she tore her lovely locks that looked so sandy-o
""Now goodbye, my love,"" said she, ""when you write please pay the post,
But before we part we'll take a drop of brandy-o.""

3. ""Take a bottle of it with you,"" to the officer she said,
""In your tent, you know, my love will be the dandy-o""
""You're right, my dear,"" said he, ""for a tent is very damp
And 'tis better in my tent to take some brandy-o""

4. So she filled him up a bumper just before he left the town,
With another for herself so neat and handy-o.
And to keep their droopin' spirits up the poured the spirits down,
For love is like the colic, cured with brandy-o.
"
71,The Ebenezer,"
I shipped on board of th' Ebenezer
Every day you ""Scrub and grease 'er""
Send us aloft to scrape 'er down
And if we growl they'll knock us down.

Chorus:
Oh, git along boys,
Git along, do;
Be handy, boys, be handy.

2. Our first mates name was Dickie Green, sir,
The dirtiest man you ever seen, sir!
Walking the quarter with a bucko cap,
He thought himself no common chap.
Chorus:

3. A Boston buck for second greaser,
He used to ship in Limejuice greasers.
The Limejuice greasers got too hot;
He made a jump for Boston dock.
Chorus:

4. We had no spuds for our dinner,
As sure as I'm a living sinner;
Our bread was tough as any brass
And our meat was as salt as Lot's wife's ass.
Chorus:
"
72,The Edmund Fitzgerald,"
The legend lives on from the Chippewa on down
Of the big lake they call Gitchigumi
The lady, it's said, never gives up her dead
When the skies of November turn gloomy.

With a load of iron ore26,000 tons more
Than the Edmund Fitzgerald weighed empty
That good ship and crew  was a bone to be chewed
When the gales of November came early

The ship was the pride of the American side
Coming back from some mill in Wisconsin
As the big freighters go it was bigger than most
With a crew and the Captain well seasoned.

Concluding some terms with a couple of steel firms
When they left fully loaded for Cleveland
And later that night when the ships bell rang
Could it be the North Wind they'd been feeling.

The wind in the wires made a tattletale sound
When the wave broke over the whaling
And every man knew, as the Captain did, too,
T'was the witch of November come stealing.

The dawn came late and the breakfast had to wait
When the gales of November came slashing
When afternoon came it was freezing rain
In the face of a hurricane West Wind

When supper time came the old cook came on deck
Saying fellows it's too rough to feed ya
At 7PM the main hatchway gave in
He said fellas it's been good to know ya.

The Captain wired in he had water coming in
And the good ship and crew was in peril
And later that night when his lights went out of sight
Came the wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald.

Does anyone know where the love of God goes
When the words turn the minutes to hours
The searchers all say they'd have made Whitefish Bay
If they'd fifteen more miles behind her.

They might have split up or they might have capsized
They may have gulfed deep and took water
And all that remains is the faces and the names
Of the wives and the sons and the daughters.

Lake Huron rolls, Superior sings
In the ruins of her ice water mansion
Ole Michigan steams like a young man's dreams,
The islands and bays are for sportsmen.

And farther below Lake Ontario
Takes in what Lake Erie can send her
The iron boats go as the mariners all know
With the gales of November remembered.

In a musty old hall in Detroit they prayed
In the Maritime Sailors' Cathedral
The church bell chimed, it rang 29 times
For each man on the Edmund Fitzgerald.

The legend lives on from the Chippewa on down
Of the big lake they call Gitchigumi
Superior, they say, never gives up her dead
When the gales of November come early.

"
73,The Erie Canal,"
We were forty miles from Albany,
Forget it, I never shall!
What a terrible storm we had one night
On the Erie Canal.
Refrain:
Oh, the Erie was rising,
And gin was getting low,
And I scarcely think we'll get a drink
Till we get to Buffalo.
2. The winds began to whistle,
And the waves began to roll,
And we had to reel our royals
On the raging canal.
Refrain:

3. We were loaded down with barley,
We were chuck up full of rye,
And the captain, he looked at me
With his gol-durn wicked eye.
Refrain:

4. Two miles out from Syracuse
The vessel struck a shoal,
And we like to all been foundered
On a chunk o' Lackawanna coal.
Refrain:

5. We hollered to the captain
On the towpath, treadin' dirt;
He jumped on board and stopped the leak
With his old red flannel shirt.
Refrain:

6. When we get to Syracuse
The off-mule he was dead,
The nigh mule got blind staggers,
And we cracked him on the head.
Refrain:

7. The cook she was a grand ol' girl,
She had a ragged dress.
We hoisted her upon a pole
As a signal of distress.
Refrain:

8. The captain, he got married,
The cook, she went to jail;
And I'm the only son-of-a-gun
That's left to tell the tale.
Refrain:
"
74,The Faithful Sailor Boy,"
'Twas on a dark and stormy night
The snow lay on the ground,
A sailor boy stood on the deck
The ship was outward bound.
His sweetheart standing by his side,
Shed many a bitter tear.
At last he pressed her to his heart
And whispered in her ear:

Chorus:
Farewell, farewell, my own true love;
This parting gives me pain.
You'll be my own, my guiding star
Until I return again.
My thought shall be of you, my love,
While storms are raging high.
So fare you well! Remember me,
Your faithful sailor boy.

2. 'Twas in a gale that ship set-sail,
The girl still standing by.
She watched the ship clear out of sight
While tears bedimmed her eyes;
She prayed to God in heaven above
To guide him on his way.
The parting words her lover spoke
Re-echoed down the bay:
Chorus:

3. 'Twas sad to see that ship return
Without that sailor boy.
He had died while out at sea;
The flags were half-mast high.
The comrades, when they came on shore,
They told her he was dead;
The letter that they gave to her
The last line sadly read:

Farewell, farewell, my own true love,
We'll meet on earth no more,
But we will meet in heaven above
On that celestial shore,
Up in that land, that glorious land,
That land of peace and joy.
Where you'll no more be parted from
Our faithful sailor boy.
"
75,Falado,"
Falado, o Falado,
Wer seilt mit nach Falado?
Jeder sucht es, keiner fand
Falado das wunderland.
Ein Mast ho, zwei Mast ho,
Dreimast seilt nach Falado.
2. Bei der Berge Edelstein
Schmeckt die See wie süßer Wein.
Schöne Frauen stehn im Wald,
Wer die küßt wird niemals alt.
Ein Mast ho, zwei Mast ho,
Dreimast, das ist Falado.

3. Hein Dreimast, der weiß bescheid,
Falado, das ist nicht weit.
Einmal luv, einmal lee,
Mitten in der Mittensee.
Ein Mast ho, zwei Mast ho,
Dreimast, das ist Falado.

4. Hein Dreimast seilt immerzu,
Reise, reise ohne Ruh'.
Halst und wendet weit und breit,
Seilt bis in die ewigkeit.
Ein Mast ho, zwei Mast ho,
Dreimast, wo bleibt Falado?

5. Ewigkeit, o seligkeit,
Zieht nun an das schönste Kleid,
Singt nun aus und Gloria,
Falado, jetzt sind wir da.
Ein Mast ho, zwei Mast ho,
Dreimast ist in Falado.
"
76,Farewell To Grogg,"
Come, messmates, pass the bottle 'round,
Our time is short, remember,
For our grogg must stop, our spirits drop,
On the first day of September.
Chorus:
: For tonight we'll merry, merry be, :
For tonight we'll merry, merry be,
Tomorrow we'll be sober.
2. Farewell old rye, 'tis a sad, sad word,
But alas! It must be spoken,
The ruby cup must be given up,
And the demijohn be broken.
Chorus:

3. Jack's happy days will soon be gone,
To return again, oh never!
For they've raised his pay five cents a day,
But stopped his grogg forever.
Chorus:

4. Yet memory oft' will backward turn,
And dwell with fondness partial,
On the days when gin was not a sin,
Nor cocktails brought court martial.
Chorus:
5. All hands to split the main brace, call,
But split it now in sorrow,
For the spirit-room key will be laid away
Forever, on tomorrow.
Chorus:
"
77,Farewell to Tarwathie,"
Farewell to Tarwathie, adieu Mormond Hill
And the dear land o' Crimond, I'll bid you fareweel
I'm bound out for Greenland and ready to sail
In hopes to find riches in hunting the whale.
2. Adieu to my comrades, for awhile we must part
And likewise the dear lass that fair won my heart
The cold ice of Greenland, my love will not chill
And the longer my absence, more loving she'll feel.
3. Our ship is well rigged and she's ready to sail
Our crew, they are anxious to follow the whale
Where the icebergs do float and the stormy winds blow
Where the land and the ocean are covered with show.
4. The cold coast of Greenland is barren and bare
No seed time nor harvest is ever known there
And the birds here sing sweetly on mountain and dale
But there isn't a birdie to sing tae the whale.
5. There is no habitation for a man to live there
And the king of that country is the fierce Greenland bear
And there will be no temptation to tarry long there
Wi' our ship bumper full, we will homeward repair.
"
78,The Female Smuggler,"
O, come list awhile, and you soon shall hear,
By the rolling sea lived a maiden fair.
Her father followed the smuggling trade,
Like a war-like hero.
Like a war-like hero that never was afraid.
2. Now, in sailor's clothing young Jane did go,
Dressed like a sailor from top to toe;
Her aged father was the only care
Of this female smuggler.
Of this female smuggler who never did despair.
3. With her pistols loaded she went abroad,
And by her side hung a glittering sword,
In her belt two daggers; well armed for war
Was this female smuggler.
Was this female smuggler, who never feared a scar.
4. Now they had not sailed far from the land,
When a strange sail brought them to a stand.
""These are sea robbers,"" this maid did cry,
""But the femal smuggler,
But the female smuggler will conquer or will die""

5. Alongside, then, this strange vessel came,
""Cheer up,"" cried Jane, ""we will board the same;
We'll run all chances to rise or fall,""
Cried this female smuggler,
Cried this female smuggler who never feared a ball.

6. Now they killed these pirates and took their store,
And soon returned to old England's shore.
With a keg of brandy she walked along,
Did this female smuggler,
Did this female smuggler, and sweetly sang a song.

7. Now they were followed by the blockade,
Who in irons strong did put this fair maid.
But when they brought her for to be terried,
This young female smuggler,
This young female smuggler stood dressed like a bride.

8. Their commodore against her appeared,
And for her life she did greatly fear.
When he did find to his great surprise
'Twas a female smuggler,
'Twas a female smuggler had fought him in disguise.

9. He to the judge and the jury said,
""I cannot prosecute this maid,
Pardon for her on my knees I crave,
For this female smuggler,
For this female smuggler so valiant and so brave.""

10. Then this commodore to her father went,
To gain her hand he asked his consent.
His consent he gained, so the commodore
And the female smuggler,
And the female smuggler are one forevermore.
"
79,Fiddler's Green,"
As I went a walking one evening so rare
To view the still waters and taste the salt air
I heard an old fisherman singing this song
Sayin', ""Take me away boys, my time is not long.

Chorus:
Wrap me up in me oil skins and blankets
No more on the docks I'll be seen
Just tell me old shipmates, I'm takin' a trip mates
And I'll see you someday on fiddler's green.""

2. Now fiddler's green is a place I've heard tell
Where fishermen go if they don't go to hell
Where the weather is fair and the dolphins do play
And the cold coast of Greenland is far far away.
Chorus:

3. Where the weather is fair and there's never a gale
Where the fish jump on board with a swish of their tail
You lie at your leisure there's no work to do
While the skipper's below makin' tea for the crew.
Chorus:

4. I don't need a harp nor a halo not me
Just give me a breeze and a good rollin' sea
I'll play me old squeeze box as we sail along
And the wind in the riggin' will sing me this song.
Chorus:
"
80,Fire Down Below,"
Chorus:
There is fire in the lower hold,
There's fire down below,
Fire in the main well,
The captain didn't know.

There is fire in the forepeak,
Fire in the main,
Fire in the windlass,
Fire in the chain.
Chorus:

2. There is fire in the foretop,
Fire down below,
Fire in the chain-plates,
The bosun didn't know.
Chorus:

3. There is fire up aloft,
There is fire down below
Fire in the galley,
The cook he didn't know.
Chorus:
"
81,Fire Maringo,"
Lift him up and carry him along,
Fire Maringo, fire him away,
Put him down where he belongs,
Fire Maringo, fire him away!

2. Ease him down and let him lay,
Fire Maringo, fire him away,
Screw him in and there he'll stay.
Fire Maringo, fire him away!

3. Put him in his hole below,
Fire Maringo, fire him away,
Stay he must and then he'll go.
Fire Maringo, fire him away!

4. When I get back to Liverpool town,
Fire Maringo, fire him away,
I'll toss a line to little Sally Brown.
Fire Maringo, fire him away!

5. I'll haul her high and haul her low,
Fire Maringo, fire him away,
I'll bust her blocks and make her go.
Fire Maringo, fire him away!

6. Sally is a pretty little craft,
Fire Maringo, fire him away,
Hot shot to the fore and rounded in the aft.
Fire Maringo, fire him away!

7. Screw the cotton screw him down,
Fire Maringo, fire him away,
Let's get the hell back to Liverpool town.
Fire Maringo, fire him away!
"
82,The Fire Ship,"
As I strolled out one evening,
Out for a night's career,
I spied a lofty ship
And after her did steer.
I hoisted her my signals
Which she very quickly knew;
And when she seed my bunting fly
She immediately hove to.

Chorus:
She's a dark and rolling eye,
And her hair hung down in ringalets.
She was a nice girl, a decent girl,
But one of the rakish kind.

2. ""O, sir, you must excuse me
For being out so late,
For if my parents knew of it,
Sad would be my fate.
My father he's a minister,
A good and honest man,
My mother she's a Methodist,
And I do the best I can.""
Chorus:

3. I took her to a tavern
And I treated her to wine,
Little did I think she belonged
To the rakish kind.
I handled her, I dandled her,
And found to my surprise,
She was nothing but a fires ship,
Rigged up in a disguise.
Chorus:

4. So, come all Ye young Seamen,
Who on the streets do sail,
If you would find companionship,
Beware the ships you hail,
I'd barely left my Fireship,
It was hardly a week gone past,
When I found the fire that burned in her
Was a-ragin' in my ma-a-ast.
Chorus:
"
83,The Flash Frigate,"
I sing of a frigate, a frigate of fame,
And in the West Indies she bore a great name,
For cruel, hard treatment of every degree,
Like slaves in the galleys we ploughed the salt sea.
2. At four in the morning our day's work begun;
""Come, lash up your hammocks, boys, every one.""
Seven turns with the lashing so neatly must show,
And all of one size through a hoop they must show.

3. The next thing we do is to holystone the decks,
Mizzen-topmen from the forehatch their buckets must fetch,
And its fore and main topmen so loudly they bawl,
Come, fetch up your holystones, squilgees and all.

4. The decks being scrubbed and the rigging coiled down,
It's clean up your bright work which is found all around,
Your gun-caps and aprons so neatly must shine,
And in white frocks and trousers you must all toe the line.

5. The next thing we hear is ""All hands to make sail!""
""Way aloft!"" and ""Lay out!"" and ""Let fall!"" is the hail,
O, your royals and your skysails and moonsails so high,
At the sound of the call your skyscrapers must fly.

6. But now, my brave boys, comes the best of the fun:
""All hands about ship and reef topsails,"" in one.
O, it's ""lay aloft, topmen,"" as the helm goes down,
And it's ""clew down your topsails,"" as the mainyard swings round.

7. ""Trice up, and lay out, and take two snug reefs in one,""
And all in one moment this work must be done.
Then man your head braces, topsail-halyards and all,
And hoist away topsails as you let go and haul.

8. Our second lieutenant, you all know him well,
He comes up on deck and cuts a great swell.
O, it's ""bear a hand here,"" and ""bear a hand there.""
And at the lee gangway he serves out our share.

9. Now, all your bold seaman who plough the salt sea,
Beware this frigate wherever she be,
For they'll beat you and bang  you till you ain't worth a damn,
And send you an invalid to your own native land.
"
84,The Flying Cloud,"
My name is Arthur Hollandin,
As you may understand
I was born ten miles from Dublin Town,
Down on the salt-sea strand,
When I was young and' comely,
Sure, good fortune on me shone,
My parents loved me tenderly
For I was their only son.
2. My father he rose up one day
And with him I did go,
He bound me as a butcher's boy
To Pearson of Wicklow,
I wore the bloody apron there
For three long years and more,
Till I shipped on board of The Ocean Queen
Belonging to Tramore.
3. It was on Bermuda's island
That I met with Captain Moore,
The Captain of The Flying Cloud,
The pride of Baltimore,
I undertook to ship with him
On a slaving voyage to go,
To the burning shores of Africa,
Where the sugar cane does grow.
4. It all went well until the day
We reached old Africa's shore,
And five hundred of them poor slaves, me boys,
From their native land we bore,
Each man was loaded down with chains
As we made them walk below,
Just eighteen inches of space
Was all that each man had to show.
5. The plague it came and fever too
And killed them off like flies,
We dumped their bodies on the deck
And hove them overside,
For sure, the dead were the lucky ones
For they'd have to weep no more,
Nor drag the chain and feel the lash
In slavery for evermore.
6. But now our money it is all spent,
We must go to sea once more,
And all but five remained to listen
To the words of Captain Moore,
""There's gold and silver to be had
If with me you'll remain,
Let's hoist the pirate flag aloft
And sweep the Spanish Main.""

7. The Flying Cloud was a Yankee ship,
Five hundred tons or more,
She could outsail any clipper ship
Hailing out of Baltimore,
With her canvas white as the driven snow
And on it there's no specks,
And forty men and fourteen guns
She carried below her decks.

8. We plundered many a gallant ship
Down on the Spanish Main,
Killed many a man and left his wife
And children to remain,
To none we showed no kindness
But gave them watery graves,
For the saying of our captain was:
""Dead men tell no tales.""

9. We ran and fought with many a ship,
Both frigates and liners too,
Till, at last, a British man-o-war,
The Dunmow, hove in view,
She fired a shot across our bows
As we ran before the wind,
And a chainshot cut our mainmast down
And we fell far behind.

10. They beat our crew to quarters
As they drew up alongside,
And soon across our quarter-deck
There ran a crimson tide,
We fought until they killed our captain
And twenty of our men,
Then a bombshell set our ship on fire,
We had to surrender then.

11. It's now to Newgate we have come,
Bound down with iron chains ,
For the sinking and the plundering of ships
On the Spanish Main,
The judge he has condemned us
And we are condemned to die.
Young men a warning by me
Take and shun all piracy.

12. Farewell to Dublin City.
And the girl that I adore,
I'll never kiss your cheek again
Nor hold your hand no more,
Whiskey and bad company
Have made a wretch of me,
Young men, a warning by me
Take and shun all piracy.
"
85,Flying P-Line,"
Wi fohrt bi de Flying P-Line
Un Geld kriegt wo gorkein.
Un ""Pamir"" heet de Schleden,
Un von 'n Dübel ward he reeden.
De Kaptein is de Dübel,
Un de Erste dat Übel.

2. Lustig ist die Reederei,
Sie verdient viel Geld dabei.
Ist der Kasten noch so alt,
Wird er wieder angemalt.

3. Nach dem Süden fährt das Schiff,
Verpoviantiert nach altem Kniff.
Salzspeck ist zehn Jahre alt,
Das Hartbrot, das vermodert bald.

4. Eines Tages: Wum bum bum,
Fällt der ganze Kasten um.
Dies geschah nicht weit vom Strand,
Was sich nennt Kanakenland.

5. Kanake dort im Busch rumort:
Der deutsche Seemann wird geschmort,
Doch haben so wir nicht gewettet,
Die ganze Mannschaft ward gerettet.

6. Sie schiffte sich nach Hamburg ein
Und schlug dem Reeder die Fenster klein.
Drum holder Jüngling, merk dir das:
Seemannsleben ist kein Spaß.
"
86,Full many a sailor points with pride,"
Full many a sailor points with pride
To cruises o’er the ocean wide;
But they cannot compare with me,
For I have sailed the Bering Sea.

2. While though you’ve weathered fiercest gale
And every ocean, you have sailed;
You cannot a salty sailor be
Until you've sailed the Bering Sea.
"
87,General Taylor,"
General Taylor gained the day
Walk him along, John, Carry him along
General Taylor gained the day
Carry him to his burying ground

Chorus:
To me way, hey, hey Stormy
Walk him along, John, carry him along
Way, hey, hey, Stormy
Carry him to his burying ground

2. I wish I was sold Stormy's son
Walk him along, John, Carry him along
I'd build me a ship of ten thousand ton
Carry him to his burying ground
Chorus:

3. I'd load her down with ale and rum
Walk him along, John, Carry him along
And every shellback should have some
Carry him to his burying ground
Chorus:

4. We dug his grave with a silver spade
Walk him along, John, Carry him along
His shroud of the finest silk was made
Carry him to his burying ground
Chorus:

5. We lowered him down on a golden chain
Walk him along, John, Carry him along
On every link we carved his name
Carry him to his burying ground
Chorus:

6. General Taylor died long ago
Walk him along, John, Carry him along
He's gone to where the winds don't blow
Carry him to his burying ground
Chorus:

7. General Taylor's dead and gone
Walk him along, John, Carry him along
General Taylor's dead and gone
Carry him to his burying ground
Chorus:
"
88,The Girl I Left Behind Me,"
The dames of France are fond and free,
And Flemish lips are willing;
And soft the maids of Italy,
And Spanish eyes are thrilling;
Still, though I bask beneath their smile,
Their charms fail to bind me.
And my heart goes back to Erin's Isle,
To the girl I left behind me.
2. For she's as fair as Shannon's side,
And purer than its water,
But she refused to be my bride
Though many years I sought her.
Yet, since to France I sailed away,
Her letters oft remind me,
That I promised never to gainsay
The girl I left behind me.
3. She says: ""My own dear love come home,
My friends are rich and many;
Or else, abroad with you I'll roam,
A soldier stout as any;
If you'll not come, nor let me go,
I'll think you have resigned me.""
My heart nigh broke when I answered ""No,""
To the girl I left behind me.

4. For never shall my truve love brave
A life of war and toiling
And never as a skulking slave
I'll tread my native soil on.
But were it free or to be free,
The battle's close would find me
To Ireland bound, nor message need
From the girl I left behind me.
"
89,The Golden Vanity,"
O there was a lofty ship and a lofty ship was she
And the name of that ship it was the Golden Vanity
And she feared she would be taken by the Turkish Enemy
As she sailed on the lowland, lowland low
As she sailed on the lowland sea
2. Up stepped a little cabin boy, a cabin boy was he
And he said to the Captain what will you give to me
If I sneak alongside the Turkish Enemy
And I sink her in the lowland, lowland low
And I sink her in the lowland sea
3. O I will give you silver and I will give you gold
And the hand of my daughter your bonnie bride will be
If you'll sneak alongside of the Turkish Enemy
And you'll sink her in the lowland lowland low
And you'll sink her in the lowland sea
4. So he jumped overboard and overboard jumped he
And he swam alongside of the Turkish Enemy
And with a little drilling tool he bored holes three
And he sank her in the lowland lowland low
He sank her in the lowland sea
5. Then he turned himself around and back again swam he
'Til he came to the side of the Golden Vanity
But the Captain would not heed, for his daughter he did need
And he left him in the lowland lowland low
He left him in the lowland sea
6. Well his shipmates brought him out, but upon the deck he died
And they wrapped him in his blanket that was so soft and wide
And they cast him overboard and he drifted with the tide
: And he sank beneath the lowland lowland low
He sank beneath the lowland sea. :

92,The Good Ship Calibar,"
Come all you dry land sailors and listen to me song
It’s only forty verses and I won’t detain yez long
It’s all about the adventures of this old Lisburn tar
Who sailed as man before the mast on the good ship Calibar.

2. The Calibar was a spanking craft it wasn’t rigged fore and aft
Her helm it stuck out far behind and her wheel was a great big shaft
With half a gale to fill her sail she do one knot per hour
She’s the fastest barge on the Lagan canal and she’s only one horsepower.

3. The captain was a strapping lad and he stood just four foot two
His eyes were black, his nose was broke and his hair was a Prussian blue.
He wore a leather medal that he’d won in the Crimea War
And the captain’s wife was the passenger’s cook on the good ship Calibar.

4. The captain said to me, me lads ""Look here me lad"" said he
""Would you like to be a sailiar and sail the seven seas
Would you like to be a sailiar and on foreign seas to roll
For we’re on the way to Portadown with half a ton of coal.

5. It was early the next morning the weather it being sublime
Whilst passing under the old Queen Bridge we heard the Albert Chime
Whilst going along by the Gasworks straight a very dangerous part
We ran aground on a lump of coal that wasn’t marked down on the chart.

6. Then all became confusion and the stormy winds did blow
The bosun slipped on an orange peel fell into the hold below
Put on more speed the captain cried for we are sorely pressed
The engineer from the bank replied ""The horse is doing his best"".

7. Then we all fell into the water and we all let out a roar
There was an old farmer standing there
And he threw us the end of his galluses and he pulled us all ashore
It’s no more I’ll be a sailiar and sail the raging main
And the next time I go to Portadown I’ll go by the bloody train.
"
93,Go To Sea No More,"
When first I landed in Frisco Bay*,
I went upon a stray
Me money alas, I spent it fast,
Got drunk as drunk could be
And when that me money was all gone
'twas then I wanted more
But a man must be blind to make up his mind
To go to sea once more.
2. I spent the night with Angeline
Too drunk to roll in bed
Me watch was new and me money too
In the morning with them she fled
And as I walked the streets about
The whores they all did roar
There goes Jack Strapp the poor sailor lad,
He must go to sea once more.
3. And as I walked the streets about
I met with the Rapper Brown
I am him for to take me on
And he looked at me with a frown
He said last time you was paid off
With me you got no score
But I'll give you a chance and I'll take your advance
And I'll send you to sea once more.
4. He shipped me on board of a whaling ship
All for the Arctic Seas
Where cold winds blow through the frost and snow
And your make your own blood freeze
But worst to bear I'ad no hard-weather gear
For I'd spent all me money on shore
'twas then that I wished that I was dead
And could go to sea no more.
5. So come all ye bold seafaring men
Who listen to me song
When you come of them long trips
I'll have you not go wrong
Take my advice drink no rum
And don't go sleeping with them whores
Get married instead and spend all night in bed
And go to sea no more.

"
94,Greenland Whale Fisheries,"
'Twas in eighteen hundred and fifty-three
In June, the thirteenth day
That our gallant ship her anchor weighed
And for Greenland sailed away, brave boys
And for Greenland sailed away.
2. The lookout on the cross-trees stood
With a spyglass in his hand
There's a whale, there's a whale
There's a whalefish, he cried,
And she blows at every span, brave boys
She blows at every span.
3. The captain stood on the quarterdeck
And a fine little man was he
Overhaul! Overhaul!
Let your davit-tackles fall
And launch your boats for sea, brave boys
And launch your boats for sea.
4. The boats where launched with the men aboard
And the whale was in full view
Resolved was each seaman bold
To steer where the whalefish blew, brave boys
To steer where the whalefish blew.
5. We struck that whale, and the line played out
But she gave a flourish with her tail
The boat capsized and four men were drowned
And we never caught that whale, brave boys
And we never caught that whale.
6. To lose that whale, our captain said
It grieves my heart full sore
But, oh, to lose four gallant men
It grieves me ten times more, brave boys
It grieves me ten times more.
7. The winter star doth now appear
So, boys, we'll anchor weigh
It's time to leave this cold country
And homeward bear away, brave boys
And homeward bear away.
8. Oh, Greenland is a dreadful place
A land that's never green
Where there's ice and snow
And the whale fishes blow
And daylight's seldom seen, brave boys
And daylight's seldom seen.
"
95,The Grey Funnel Line,"
Don't mind the rain or the rolling sea
The weary night never worries me
But the hardest time in a sailor's day
Is to watch the sun as it dies away
Here's one more day on the Grey Funnel Line.
2. The finest ship that sails the sea
Is still a prison for the likes of me
But give me wings like Noah's dove
I'll fly up harbour to the girl I love
Here's one more day on the Grey Funnel Line.
3. O, once my heart was wild and free
Like a flashing spar on the open sea
But now that spar has washed ashore
And come to rest at my true love's door
Here's one more day on the Grey Funnel Line.
4. Each time I gaze behind the screws
Makes me long for Saint Peter's shoes
I'd dance on down that Walker Shore
And rest in my true love's arms once more
Here's one more day on the Grey Funnel Line.
5. O Lord if dreams were only real
I'd feel my hands on that wooden wheel
And with all my heart I'd turn her round
And tell the boys that we're homeward bound
Here's one more day on the Grey Funnel Line.
6. I'll pass the time like some machine
Until the waters turn to green
Then I'll dance on down that walk ashore
: And sail the Grey Funnel Line no more. :
"
96,The Handsome Cabin Boy,"
It's of a pretty fair maid
As you shall understand
She had a mind for roving
Unto a foreign land
Attired in sailor's clothing
She boldly did appear
And engaged with the captain for
To serve him for a year.
2. She engaged with the captain
A cabin boy to be
The wind it was in favour,
They soon put out to sea
The captain's lady being on board
She seemed it to enjoy
So glad the captain had engaged
A handsome cabin boy.
3. So nimble was that pretty maid
And done her duty well
But mark what followed after,
As she herself can tell
The captain with that pretty maid
Did often kiss and toy
For he soon found out the secret of
The handsome cabin boy.
4. Her cheeks appeared like roses
And with her side-locks curled
The sailors ofttimes smiled and said,
He looks just like a girl
But eating captains biscuit
Her colour did destroy
And the waist did swell of pretty Nell
The handsome cabin boy.
5. As through the Bay of Biscay
Their gallant ship did plough
One night among the sailors
There was a pretty row
They bundled from their hammocks,
It did their rest destroy
And they swore about the groaning of
The handsome cabin boy.
6. O doctor, O doctor,
The cabin boy did cry
The sailors swore by all that's good
The cabin boy would die
The doctor ran with all his might
And smiling at the fun
For to think a sailor lad should have
A daughter or a son.
7. The sailors when they heard the joke
They all began to stare
The child belonged to none of them
They solemnly did swear
The lady to the captain said,
My dear I wish you joy
For it's either you or I betrayed
The handsome cabin boy.
8. So they all took up a bumper
And drank success to trade
And likewise to the cabin boy,
Though neither man nor maid
And if the wars should rise again
The sailors to destroy
We'll ship some other sailors like
The handsome cabin boy.
"
97,Hanging Johnny,"
They call me hanging Johnny,
Away, boys, away!
They say I hang for money!
So hang, boys, hang down!

2. They say I hanged my mother,
Away, boys, away!

I'd hang 'em by their flippers
So hang, boys, hang down!

Away, boys, away!
I'll hang ye all together
So hang, boys, hang down!

7. Hang `em from the yardarm,
Away, boys, away!
Hang the sea and buy a pigfarm
So hang, boys, hang down!

8. They say I hang for money,
Away, boys, away!
Hanging ain't bloody funny
So hang, boys, hang down!

9. They call me hanging Johnny,
Away, boys, away!
Ain't never hanged nobody
So hang, boys, hang down!

Away, haul away,

Away, haul away,

When I was a little lad,
My mother told me,
Away, haul away,
O, haul away together,
That if I did not kiss the girls
My lips would grow moldy
Away, haul away,
O, haul away, Joe!

So first I had a Spanish girl
But she was fat and lazy,
Away, haul away,
O, haul away together,
But now I've got an Irish girl
And she nearly drives me crazy.
Away, haul away,
O, haul away, Joe!

Away, haul away,

King Louis was the king of France
Before the revolution,
Away, haul away,

But the people chopped his head off
Which spoiled his constitution

Away, haul away,
O, haul away together,

101,Henry Martin,"
There were three brothers in merry Scotland
In Scotland there lived brothers three
And they did cast lots which of them should go,
For to turn robber all on the salt sea.
2. The lot it fell first upon Henry Martin
The youngest of all the three,
That he should turn robber all on the salt sea
For to maintain his two brothers and he.
3. He had not been sailing but a long winter's night
And part of a short winter's day
When he espied a rich lofty ship,
Come a bibing down him straight away.
4. ""Hello, hello!"" cried Henry Martin,
""What makes you sail so high?""
I'm a rich merchant ship bound for fair London town.
Won't you please for to let me pass by?

5. ""O no, o no!"" cried Henry Martin
That thing it never can be
For I have turned robber all on the salt sea,
For to maintain my two brothers and me.

6. So lower your topsail and bail up your mizzen
Bring yourself under my lee,
Or I shall give you a fast flowing ball
And your dear bodies drown in the salt sea.

7. Then broadside and broadside and at it they went
For fully two hours or three
Til Henry Martin gave to her the death shot
Heavily listing to starboard went she.

8. The rich merchant vessel was wounded full sore
Straight to the bottom went she.
And Henry Martin sailed away
... on the salt sea.

9. Sad news, sad news to old England came
Sad news to fair London town
There was a rich vessel and she's cast away
And all of her merry men drowned.

From old England came
Blow high, blow low
And so sail we
One was the Prince of Luther

Was we sank 'em in the sea

"
106,The HMS Hood,"
When HMS Hood went down in the deep,
That was the news that made mothers weep;
For the sons who had fought for a country so proud
Were down there below with the sea as their shroud.
They're sleeping in heavenly peace, sleeping in heavenly peace.
2. Then came George V, the Prince of Wales too,
They took in hand what the Hood had to do.
The Suffolk, the Norfolk, the Cossack as well,
Along with the Rodney shelled Bismarck to hell.
They sank that ship, oh, we're glad; but for our lads we feel sad.
3. So mothers and wives and sweethearts, be proud;
Though your dear lads have the sea as their shroud,
They were fighting for freedom, let's never forget.
The freedom they fought for will be won yet.
They're sleeping in heavenly peace, sleeping in heavenly peace.
"
107,The Hog-Eye Man,"

For I'm goin' to see my darlin' Jane!

And a hog-eye railroad nigger with his hog-eye
Row the boat ashore, and a hog-eye O!

Her golden hair hanging down to her knees,

A bold Jack Tar sitting on her knee.

You Yankee Tar with your sea-boots on.

With a hog’s-eye mate and a skipper too.

"
108,The Holy Ground,"
Adieu my fair young maidens,
A thousand times adieu
We must bid goodbye to the Holy Ground,
The place that we love true
We will sail the salt seas over
And return again for sure
To seek the girls that wait for us,
In the Holy Ground once more.

Refrain:
Fine girl you are,
You're the girl that I do adore,
And still I live in hope to see,
The Holy ground once more
Fine girl you are!

2. We're on the salt sea sailing
And you are safe behind
Fond letters I will write to you,
The secrets of my mind
Fond letters I will write to you,
The girl I do adore
And still I live in hope to see,
The Holy ground once more.
Refrain:

3. I see a storm arising,
I can see it coming soon
For the night is dark and dreary,
You can scarcely see the moon.
And the good ship she is tossing about,
And her riggings is all tore
But still I live in hope to see,
The Holy ground once more.
Refrain:

4. And now the storm is over
And we are safe on shore
And a health we'll drink to the Holy Ground
And the girls we do adore
We will drink strong ale and porter
And make the taprooms roar
And when our money is all spent
We will go to sea for more.
Refrain:
"
109,Homeward Bound,"
To Pensacola town we'll bid adieu,
To lovely Kate and pretty Sue.
Our anchor's weighed and our sails unfurled,
We're bound for to plough this watery world.

Chorus:
You know we're outward bound,
Hurrah, we're outward bound!

2. The wind blows hard from the east nor-east,
Our ship sails ten knots at least,
The skipper will our wants supply,
And while we've grog we'll ne'er say die.
Chorus:

3. And should we touch at Malabar,
Or any other port so far,
Our skipper will tip the chink,
And just like fishes we will drink.

4. And now our three years it is out,
It's very near time we back'd about;
And when we're home, and do get free,
O, won't we have a jolly spree.

5. And now we'll haul into the docks,
Where all the pretty girls come in flocks,
And one to the other they will say,
""Here comes Jack with his three years' pay!""
Chorus:

Where there's good liquor for to sell,
In comes old Archer with a smile,
Saying, ""Drink, my lads, it's worth your while.""
Chorus:

7. But when our money's all gone and spent,
And none to be borrowed nor none to be lent,
In comes old Archer with a frown,
Saying, ""Get up, Jack, let John sit down.""
Chorus:

110,A Hundred Years Ago,"
A hundred years is a very long time,
Oh yes, oh,
A hundred years is a very long time
A hundred years ago.

2. They used to think that pigs could fly
Oh yes, oh,
I don't believe it no, not I
A hundred years ago.

3. They thought the moon was made of cheese
Oh yes, oh,
You can believe it, if you please
A hundred years ago.

4. They thought the stars was set alight
Oh yes, oh,
By some good angel every night
A hundred years ago.

5. They hung a man for making steam
Oh yes, oh,
They cast his body in the stream
A hundred years ago.

6. A hundred years is a very long time
Oh yes, oh,
A hundred years is a very long time
A hundred years ago.

It's time for us to go!

Belay!

111,I Am A Brisk and Sprightly Lad,"
I am a brisk and sprightly lad,
But just come home from sea, sir.
Of all the lives I ever led,
A sailor's life for me, sir.

Chorus:
Yeo, yeo, yeo,
Whilst the boatswain pipes all hands,
With a yeo, yeo, yeo!

2. What girl but loves the merry tar,
We o'er the ocean roam, sir.
In every clime we find a port,
In every port a home, sir.
Chorus:

3. But when our country's foes are nigh,
Each hastens to his guns, sir.
We make the boasting Frenchman fly,
And bang the haughty Dons, sir.
Chorus:

4. Our foes reduced, once more on shore,
And spend our cash with glee, sir.
And when all's gone we drown our care,
And out to sea again, sir.
Chorus:
"
112,I Come From Salem City,"
I came from Salem City,
With my washbowl on my knee.
I'm going to California
The gold dust for to see.
It rained all night the day I left,
The weather it was dry,
The sun so hot I froze to death
Oh, brothers, don't you cry!

Chorus:
Oh, California,
That's the land for me!
I'm bound for San Francisco
With my washbowl on my knee!

2. I jumped aboard the 'Liza ship
And traveled on the sea,
And every time I thought of home
I wished it wasn't me!
The vessel reared like any horse
That had of oats a wealth;
I found it wouldn't throw me, so
I thought I'd throw myself!
Chorus:

3. I thought of all the pleasant time
We've had together here,
I thought I ought to cry a bit,
But couldn't find a tear.
The pilot bread was in my mouth,
The gold dust in my eye,
And though I'm going far away,
Dear brothers, don't you cry!
Chorus:

4. I soon shall be in 'Frisco,
And there I shall look around,
And when I see the gold lumps there
I'll pick them off the ground.
I'll scrape the mountains clean, my boys,
I'll drain the rivers dry,
A pocketful of rocks bring home
So, brothers, don't you cry!
Chorus:
"
113,I Popped Out,"
I  used to be a sailor, I sailed upon the sea,
And when I was at home my wife was very good to me,
But I commenced to worry and to wonder what she'd do,
When I was off a-sailing out upon the ocean blue.
What if I popped out and I caught her unawares,
Popped out sudden from the cupboard in the stairs,
Popped out, popped up, and took her by surprise,
Sometimes me boys it's better to be ignorant than wise.

2. I kissed me wife goodbye and told her I was bound to sail
Upon a Yankee whaling ship they called the Horse's Tail,
I told 'er I'd return again in six months or a year,
Then I hid meself beneath the stairs to see what should appear.
If I popped out and I caught her unawares,
Popped out sudden from the cupboard in the stairs,
Popped out, popped up, popped aloft to see
If my little wife was mis'rable and lonely without me.

3. Well, first there came the cabin boy, and then there came the cook,
She had 'em by appointment in a red appointment book,
The bo'sun piped himself aboard, and played a merry tune,
And last there came the captain with his bloody great harpoon.
Then I popped out and I caught 'em unawares,
Popped out sudden from the cupboard in the stairs,
Popped out, popped up, and popped 'em out the door,
And I vowed an oath I never would go sailing any more.

4. Now let this be a warning to all you jolly tars
Who leave your wives at home to go off sailing near and far.
Meself, I'm a greengrocer now, me flat's above me shop,
And any time I have the chance it's up the stairs I pop,
Yes I pop up and I catch her unawares,
I pop her in the parlor and I pop her on the stairs,
Pop in, pop out, and pop back to the till,
And you can take your bloody sailing ships, and pop 'em where you will.
"
114,Jackie Brown,"
When I first landed in Liverpool I went upon a spree
Being paid off at last I spent it fast got drunk as drunk could be
And when me money was all gone it was then I wanted more
A man must be blind to make up his mind to go to sea once more
Once more, once more, once more, me lads once more
A man must be blind to make up his mind to go to sea once more.
2. A Lime Street girl drew up to me and offered me a bed
But when I awoke on the next day’s morn with me watch and me money she’d fled
And as I walk the streets about the whores they all do roar
""There goes young Jack the sailor lad he must go to sea once more""
Once more, once more, once more, me lads once more
""There goes young Jack the sailor lad he must go to sea once more""

3. As I was walking down the street I met with Jackie Brown
I asked him if he’d take me in, he eyed me with a frown
He said, ""Last time you was paid off with me you ran up a score
But I’ll take a chance and I’ll give an advance and I’ll send you to sea once more""
Once more, once more, once more, me lads once more
But I’ll take a chance and I’ll give an advance and I’ll send you to sea once more""

4. He shipped me aboard a whaling ship that was bound for Arctic seas
Where the cold winds blow and the frost and snow would make your rum ration freeze
And worse to say I’ve no hard weather gear for I’ve lost all me money ashore
My God, how I wish that I was dead and I’d go to sea no more
No more, no more, no more, me lads no more
My God, how I wish that I was dead and I’d go to sea no more.

5. Sometimes we’re catching whales, me lads and sometimes we’re catching none
With a twenty foot oar stuck in your hand from four o’clock in the morn
And when the shades of night come on you rest your weary oar
Tis then that you wish that you were dead or safe with the girls ashore
Ashore, ashore, ashore me lads ashore
Tis then that you wish that you were dead or safe with the girls ashore.

6. So come all you bold seafaring lads and listen to me song
When you come off those long, long trips I pray you’ll never go wrong
Take my advice, drink no strong wine and take up with no whore
Get married instead, have all night in bed and go to sea no more
No more, no more, no more, me lads no more
Get married instead, have all night in bed and go to sea no more.
"
115,Jack the Guinea Pig,"
When the anchor's weigh'd and the ship's unmoored,
And the landsmen lag behind, sir,
The sailor joyful skips aboard,
And, swearing, prays for a wind, sir!

Towing here,
Yehoing there,
Steadily, readily,
Cheerily, merrily,
Still from care and thinking free,
Is a sailor's life at sea.

2. When we sail with a fresh'ning breeze,
And the landsmen all grow sick, sir,
The sailor lolls, with his mind at ease,
And the song and the can go quick, sir!
Laughing here,
Quaffing there,
Steadily, readily, etc.

3. When the wind at night whistles o'er the deep,
And sings to the landsmen dreary,
The sailor fearless goes to sleep,
Or takes his watch most cheery!
Boozing here,
Snoozing there,
Steadily, readily, etc.

4. When the sky grows black and the wind blows hard,
And the landsmen skulk below, sir,
Jack mounts up to the top-sail yard,
And turns his quid as he goes, sir!
Hauling here,
Bawling there,
Steadily, readily, etc.

5. When the foaming waves run mountains high,
And the landsmen cry, ""All's gone, sir,""
The sailor hands 'twixt sea and sky,
And he jokes with Davy Jones, sir!
Dashing here,
Clashing there,
Steadily, readily, etc.

6. When the ship, d'ye see, becomes a wreck,
And the landsmen hoist the boat, sir,
The sailor scorns to quit the deck,
While a single plan's afloat, sir!
Swearing here,
Tearing there,
Steadily, readily, etc.

For my merry men and for me, a,

5. And Nicholl was then a Cornish man,
A little beside Bohyde, a,
And he manned forth a good black bark
With fifty good oars on a side, a.
6. Run up, my boy, unto the maintop,
And look what thou canst syp, a.
Who ho, who ho, a goodly ship I do see;
I trow it to be John Dory, a.

The mizen and all was tried, a;
And every man stood to his lot,
Whatever should betide, a.
8. The roaring cannons then were plied,
And dub a dub went the drum, a;
The braying trumpets loud they cried
To courage both all and some, a.

120,La Paloma,"
The day that I left my home for the rolling sea
I said ""Mother dear, Oh, pray to thy God for me.""
And ere we sailed I went fond leave to take
Of Niña, who wept as if her poor heart would break.

Niña, if I should die and o'er oceans foam,
Softly a white dove on a fair eve should come.
Open thy lattice, dearest, for it will be,
My faithful soul that loving comes back to thee!

: Oh! a life on the sea!
Singing joyous and free,
Oh! we're going
None are so gay as we! :

And when I come home from Niña to part no more,
Adieu to the ship where often with changing mind
I've laughed and I've wept as veer'd the light changing wind.

The comes the day, the happy and blessed day,
Chasing all sadness, sorrow and care away.
Niña so fair, all smiles will be by my side!
Niña so dear, will be my own blushing bride.

For when I return, united we will be
It's not the leaving of Liverpool that grieves me,
But my darling when I think of thee

2. I have shipped on a Yankee sailing ship,
Davy Crockett is her name,
And her Captain's name was Burgess,
And they say that she's a floating shame.
Chorus:

3. It’s me second trip with Burgess on the Crocket
And I think I know him well
If a man’s a seaman he’ll get along
But if not then he’s sure in hell.
Chorus:

4. Oh the sun is on the harbour, love,
And I wish that I could remain,
For I know that it will be a long, long time,
Before I see you again

Ah! la feuille s'envole, s'envole
Ah! la feuille s'envole au vent!

Sont les filles de la Rochelle
Ont armé un bâtiment
Pour aller faire la course
Dedans les îles du Levant.

2. La grande vergue est en ivoire
Les poulies en diamant
La grande voile est en dentelle
La misaine en satin blanc.

3. Les cordages du navire
Sont des fils d'or et d'argent
Et la coque est en bois rouge
Travaillé fort proprement.

4. L'équipage du navire
C'est toutes des filles de quinze ans
Le capitaine qui les commande
Est le roi des bons enfants.

5. Hier faisant sa promenade
Dessus le gaillard d'avant
Aperçut une brunette
Qui pleurait dans les haubans.

6. Qu'avez-vous, jeune brunette
Qu'avez-vous à pleurer tant?
Avez vous perdu père et mère
Où quelqu'un de vos parents.

7. J'ai perdu la rose blanche
Qui s'en fut la voile au vent
Elle est partie vent arrière
Reviendra-z-en louvoyant.
"
123,Le Forban,"
A moi forban que m'importe la gloire
Les lois du monde et qu'importe la mort?
Sur l'océan j'ai planté ma victoire
Et bois mon vin dans une coupe d'or.
Vivre d'orgies est ma seule espérance
Le seul bonheur que j'aie pu conquérir
Si sur les flots j'ai passé mon enfance
C'est sur les flots qu'un forban doit mourir.

Refrain:
Vins qui pétillent
Femmes gentilles
Sous des baisers brûlants d'amour
Plaisirs, batailles
Viv' la canaille
Je bois, je chante
Et je tue tour à tour.

2. Peut-être au mât d'une barque étrangère
Mon corps un jour servira d'étendard
Et tout mon sang rougira la galère
Aujourd'hui fête et demain le bazar.
Allons, esclave, allons, debout mon brave
Buvons le vin et la vie à grand pot
Aujourd'hui fête et puis demain peut-être
Ma tête ira s'engloutir dans les flots.
Refrain:

3. Peut-être un jour par un coup de fortune
Je saisirai l'or d'un beau galion
Riche à pouvoir vous acheter la lune
Je m'en irai vers d'autres horizons.
Là respecté tout comme un gentil'homme
Moi qui ne suis qu'un forban, qu'un bandit
Je pourrai comm' le fils d'un roi, tout comme,
Mourir peut-être dedans un bon lit.
Refrain:"
124,A Life on the Ocean Wave,"
A life on the ocean wave,
A-home on the rolling deep!
Where the scater'd waters rave,
And the winds their revels keep.
Like an eagle caged I pine
On this dull, unchanging shore.
Oh give me the flashing brine,
The spray and the tempest's roar.

Refrain:
A life on the ocean wave,
A-home on the rolling deep!
Where the scater'd waters rave
And the winds their revels keep,
: The winds,..... the winds...
The winds their revels...keep. :

2. Once more on the deck I stand,
Of my own swift, gliding craft.
Set sail, farewell to land,
The gale follows fair abaft.
We shoot thro' the sparkling foam,
Like an ocean bird set free.
Like the ocean bird, our home,
We'll find far out on the sea.
Refrain:

3. The land is no longer in view,
The clouds have begun to frown.
But with a stout vessel and crew,
We'll say : Let the storm come down!
And the song of our heart shall be,
While the winds and waters lave:
A life on the heaving sea,
A-home on the bounding wave!
Refrain:
"

126,Lisbon,"
'Twas on a Monday morning, all in the month of May,
Our ship she weighed up anchor all for to sail away,
The wind it from the southwest blew, for Lisbon we were bound,
The hills and dales were covered with pretty young girls around.
2. I wrote a letter to Nancy, for her to understand,
That I should have to leave her unto some foreign land,
She said, my dearest William these words do break my heart,
Oh let us married be tonight, dear Willy before you start.
3. For ten long weeks or better I've been with child by thee,
So stay at home dear William be kind and marry me,
Our captain has commanded us and I shall have to go,
The Queens in want of men my love I never dare answer no.
4. I'll cut my long yellow hair mens clothing I'll put on,
And I will go with you my love and be your waiting man,
And when it is your watch on deck your duty I will do,
I'll face the field of battle love in order to be with you.
5. Your pretty little fingers they are but long and small,
Your waist it is too slender to face the cannon ball,
For loud the cannon rattle love and blazing bullets fly,
And silver trumpets sound my love to cover the dismal cry.
6. If I should meet with a lady that's proper tall and gay,
If I should fancy her my love what would you have to say,
Would you not be offended then oh no my lover true,
I'd stand aside sweet William whenever she pleasures you.
7. Twas on a Monday morning all in the month of May,
Our ship she weighed up anchor all for to sail away,
The wind it from the southwest blew for Lisbon we were bound,
The hills and dales were covered with pretty young girls around.
"
127,Little Mohee or Indian Lass,"
As I was a-walkin' upon a fine day
I got awful lonesome as the day passed away
I sat down a-musing, alone on the grass
When who should sit by me but a sweet Indian lass.
2. She sat down beside me and took hold of my hand
Said, ""You sure be a stranger, and in a strange land.""
She asked me to marry and gave me her hand,
Said, ""My pappy's a chieftain all over this land.""

3. ""My pappy's a chieftain, and ruler be he
I'm his only daughter and my name is Mohee""
I answered and told her that it never could be
'Cause I had my own sweetheart in my own country.

4. I had my own sweetheart, and I knew she loved me
Her heart was as true as any Mohee
So I said, ""I must leave you and goodbye my dear
There's wind in my canvas and home I must steer.""

5. At home with relations I tried for to see
But there wasn't a one like my little Mohee,
And the girl I had trusted proved untrue to me
So I sailed o'er the ocean to my little Mohee.
"
128,The Liverpool Judies,"
From Liverpool to 'Frisco a-rovin' I went,
For to stay in that country was my good intent.
But drinkin' strong whiskey like other damn fools,
Oh, I soon got transported back to Liverpool, singin'.

Chorus:
Roll, roll, roll bullies, roll!
Them Liverpool judies have got us in tow.

2. A smart Yankee packet lies out in the Bay,
A-waitin' a fair wind to get under way.
With all of her sailors so sick and so sore,
They'd drunk all their whiskey and can't get no more.
Chorus:

3. Oh, here comes the mate in a hell of a stew.
He's lookin' for work for us sailors to do.
Oh, it's ``Fore tops'l halyards!'' he loudly does roar,
And it's lay aloft Paddy, ye son-o'-a-whore!
Chorus:

4. One night of Cape Horn I shall never forget,
'Tis oft-times I sighs when I think of it yet.
She was divin' bows under with her sailors all wet,
She was doin' twelve knots wid her mainskys'l set.
Chorus:

5. And now we are haulin' way on to the Line,
When I thinks of it now, sure, we had a good time.
Them sea-boys box-haulin' them yards all around
For to beat that flash packet called the Thatcher MacGowan.
Chorus:

6. And now we've arrived in the Bramleymoor Dock,
And all them flash judies on the pierhead do flock.
The barrel's run dry and our five quid advance,
And I guess it's high time for to git up and dance.
Chorus:

7. Here's a health to the Captain wherever he may be,
A bucko on land and a bully at sea,
But as for the chief mate, the dirty ol' brute,
We hope when he dies straight to hell he'll skyhoot.
Chorus:

2------------------
When I was a youngster I sailed with the rest
On a Liverpool packet bound out for the West.
We anchored one day in the harbor of Cork,
Then we put out for the port of New York.

Chorus:
And it's row, row bullies, row,
Them Liverpool judies have got us in tow.

2. For forty two days we was hungry and sore.
Oh, the winds was again'us, the gales, they did roar.
But off Battery Point we did anchor at last
With our jib'boom hove to and the canvas all fast.
Chorus:

3. The boardinghouse masters was off in a trice
A'shouting and promising all that was nice,
And one fat old crimp took a fancy to me.
Says he, ``You're a fool, lad, to follow the sea.''
Chorus:

4. Says he, ``There's a job as is waiting for you,
With lashings o'liquor and bugger'all to do.''
Says he, ``Wha'd'yer say, lad, will you jump her too?''
Says I, ``You old bastard, I'm damned if I do.''
Chorus:

5. But the best of intentions, they never goes far.
After thirty two days at the door of a bar
I tossed off me liquor and what do you think?
That rotten old bastard had drugs in me drink.
Chorus:

6. The next I remember, I woke in the morn
On a three skys'l yarder bound south round Cape Horn.
With an old suit of oilskins and two pairs of socks
And a bloomin' great head and a dose of the pox.
Chorus:

7. Now all you young sailors take a warnin' by me.
Keep an eye on yer drinks when the liquor is free.
And pay no attention to runner or whore
When your hat's on your head and your feet's on the shore.
Chorus:
"
129,A Long Time Ago,"
A long, long time, and a long time ago,
To me way, hay, o-hio!
A long, long time, and a long time ago,
A long time ago!

2. A smart Yankee packet lay out in the bay,
To me way, hay, o-hio!
Awaiting for a fair wind to get under way,
A long time ago!

3. With all her poor sailors sick and all sad,
To me way, hay, o-hio!
For they'd drunk all their whiskey, no more could be had,
A long time ago!

4. She was waiting for a fair wind to get under way,
To me way, hay, o-hio!
If she hasn't had a fair wind she's lying there still.
A long time ago!

A dollar a day is a stevedore's pay
To me way ha ha yah!
Dollar a day, I heard them say,
And a long time ago.

2. I bought in Hong Kong a pretty silk dress,
To me way ha ha yah!
I'm taking it home to my sweetheard Bess,
And a long time ago.

3. My Bess is fair and sweet to view,
To me way ha ha yah!
Her hair is brown and her eyes are blue,
And a long time ago.

4. I thought I heard our second mate say,
To me way ha ha yah!
One more pull, and then belay,
And a long time ago.
"
130,Loss of the U.S. Sloop of War Hornet!!!,"
Ye seamen and ye landsmen all,
Ye mothers and widows too:
Attend unto my story,
About the Hornet's crew.

2. She sail'd from New York harbour,
Bound to the Spanish Main;
There to protect our commerce,
But ne'er returned again.

3. She convoy'd many vessels,
And was the pirate's dread;
Still more than death they hated
The Hornet's boats, 'tis said.

4. For NORRIS, her commander,
Would send his gallant men,
To scour the coast by sea and land,
And find each pirate's den.

5. Our merchants they protected,
And their little gain
They snatch'd, with brave exertion,
From the hands of Spain.

6. Our merchants they protected,
And would have brought them home,
But, ah! her brave commander,
Knew not the Hornet's doom.

7. On the tenth day of September,
She off Tampico lay;
And many well remember,
The gale that blew that day.

8. She had to slip her cables,
She had to put to sea;
That deadly blast, it is the last,
Brother, I'll hear from thee.

9. The widow's heart is breaking,
Hope no more can charm;
The mother's heart is aching,
And love, why her alarm.

10. She sees the proud ship sinking,
Beneath the hungry wave;
Her love death's cup is drinking,
She shrieks, but cannot save.

11. ""My Henry was on board of her,""
The weeping mother cries;
""He was my youngest, dearest son,
The one I most did prize.

12. He was too proud to stoop or crawl,
To men of low degree;
He lost his fortune on the land,
And sought it on the sea.

13. But he is dead, the gallant boy,
And why should I repine?
There's many a mother lost a son,
As proud and fair as mine.

14. And many a blooming youthful bride,
With her infant at her breast,
Sheds o'er the orphan child a tear,
And feels as much distress'd.""

15. The Hornet's lost, the good and brave
Are in the ocean deep;
No arm was nigh her crew to save,
She sank! and thousands weep.

16. In Congress now we must repose,
Our only hope, to gain,
A remedy, though small, for those,
Who lost all on the main.

"
131,Lowlands,"
I dreamed my love came in my sleep,
Lowlands, Lowlands, away, my John.
His eyes were wet as he did weep,
My Lowlands, away!

2. I shall never kiss you again, he said,
Lowlands, Lowlands, away, my John.
For I am drowned in the Lowland seas.
My Lowlands, away!

3. No other man shall think me fair,
Lowlands, Lowlands, away, my John.
My love lies drowned in the windy Lowlands,
My Lowlands, away!"
132,"Lustily, Lustily","
All things we have ready and nothing we want
To furnish our hsip that rideth hereby.
Victuals and weapons they be nothing scant;
Like worthy mariners ourselves we will try.

2. Her flags be new trimmed, set slanting aloft.
Our ship for swift swimming, oh she doth excel.
We fear no enemies, we have escaped them oft;
Of all things that swimmeth she beareth the bell.

3. And here is a master excelleth in skill,
And our master's mate he is not to seek;
And here is a boatswain will do his good will,
And here is a ship boy we never had his like.

4. If fortune then fail not, and our next voyage prove,
We will return merrily and make good cheer;
And hold all together as friends linked in love,
The cans shall be filled with wine, ale and beer.

"
133,Maggie May,"
Now you jolly sailor lads, come listen to my tale,
I'm sure you will have cause to pity me,
I was a damned young fool in the port of Liverpool,
When I called there on my first port home from sea.

Chorus:
Oh Maggie, Maggie May
They have taken her away
To slave upon Van Dieman's cruel shore.
Oh, you robbed so many whalers,
And dosed so many sailors
But you'll never cruise 'round
Peter Street no more.

2. I was staying at the Home, from a voyage to Sierre Leone,
And two-pound-ten a month was all my pay,
As I jingled with my tin, I was easy taken in,
By a little girl up there called Maggie May.
Chorus:

3. Oh. I'll never forget the day when I first met Maggie May,
She was standing on a corner at Canning Place,
In a full-sized crin-o-line, like a frigate of the line,
And as she saw I was a sailor I gave chase.
Chorus:

4. She gave me a saucy nod, and I, like a farmer's clod,
Let her take me line abreast in tow,
And under all plain sail, we ran before the gale
And to the Crow's Nest Tavern we did go.
Chorus:

5. Next morning when I woke, I found that I was broke,
No shoes or shirt or trousers could I find,
When I asked her where they were, she answers ""My dear sir,
They're down in Lewis' pawnshop number nine.""
Chorus:

6. So to Lewis' I did go, but no clothing could I find,
And the policeman took that wicked girl away,
And the judge he guilty found her, of robbing a homeward-bounder,
And now she's doing time in Botany Bay.
Chorus:

7. She was chained and sent away from Liverpool one day,
The lads all cheered as she sailed down the bay,
And every sailor lad, he only was too glad
They'd sent that old whore out to Botany Bay.
Chorus:
"
134,Maid of Amsterdam,"
In Amsterdam there dwells a maid,
Mark well what I do say;
In Amsterdam there dwells a maid,
And she is mistress of her trade.
Chorus:
I'll go no more a-roving
With you, fair maid,
A-roving, a-roving,
Since roving's been my ruin,
I'll go no more a-roving
With you, fair maid!

2. I took the maiden for a walk
Mark well what I do say!
I took the maiden for a walk
And sweet and loving was her talk.
Chorus:

3. Her eyes are blue, her cheeks are red,
Mark well what I do say;
Her eyes are blue, her cheeks are red,
A wealth of hair is on her head.
Chorus:

4. I put my arm around her waist,
Mark well what I do say;
I put my arm around her waist,
Says she, ""Young man, you're in some haste.""
Chorus:

5. I took that girl upon my knee,
Mark well what I do say,
I took that girl upon my knee,
Says she, ""Young man, you're rather free.""
Chorus:

6. She swore that she'd be true to me,
Mark well what I do say,
She swore that she'd be true to me,
But spent my money both fast and free.
Chorus:

7. In three weeks' time I was badly bent
Mark well what I do say!
In three weeks' time I was badly bent
Then off to sea I sadly went
Chorus:
"
135,Marine Hymn,"
From the Halls of Montezuma
To the shores of Tripoli,
We fight our country's battles
In the air, on land and sea
First to fight for right and freedom,
And to keep our honor clean,
We are proud to claim the title
Of United States Marine.

2. Our Flag's unfulr'd to every breeze
From dawn to setting sun;
We have fought in every clime and place
Where we could take a gun.
In the snow of far-off northern lands
And in sunny tropic scenes,
You will find us always on the job
The Unites States Marines.

3. Here's health to you and to our Corps
Which we are proud to serve;
In many a strife we've fought for life
And never lost our nerve.
If the Army and the Navy
Ever look on Heaven's scenes,
They will find the streets are guarded
By United States Marines!
"
136,The Mermaid,"
It was Friday morn when we set sail,
And we were not far from the land
When our Captain he spied a mermaid so fair
With a comb and a glass in her hand.
Chorus:
And the ocean waves do roll
And the stormy winds do blow
And we poor sa-li-ors go skippin' at the top
While the landlubbers lie down below!

2. Then up spoke the captain of our gallant ship
And a fine old man was he!
""This sweet mermaid has warned us of our doom;
We shall sink to the bottom of the sea!""
Chorus:

3. Then up spoke the mate of our gallant ship,
And a fine spoken man was he!
Said ""I have a wife in Brooklyn by the sea,
And tonight a widow she will be!""
Chorus:

4. Then up spoke the cabin-boy of our gallant ship,
And a brave young lad was he!
Said ""I have a sweetheart in Salem by the sea,
And tonight she'll be weepin' there for me!""
Chorus:

5. Then up spoke the cook of our gallant ship,
And a crazy old butcher was he!
Said ""I care much more for my pots and my pans
Than I do for the bottom of the sea!""
Chorus:

6. Then three times round spun our gallant ship,
And three times round spun she;
Three times round spun our gallant ship,
And she sank to the bottom of the sea!
Chorus:
"
137,My Bonny,"
My Bonny is over the ocean,
My Bonny is over the sea.
My Bonny is over the ocean.
Oh bring back my Bonny to me.
Chorus:
Bring back, bring back,
Oh bring back my Bonny to me, to me.
Bring back, bring back,
Oh bring back my Bonny to me.

2. Last night as I laid at my pillow,
Last night as I laid in my bed.
Last night as I laid on my pillow
I dreamed that my Bonny was dead.
Chorus:

3. The winds have gone over the ocean,
The winds have gone over the sea.
The winds have gone over the ocean,
And brought back my Bonny to me.
Chorus:
Brought back, brought back,
Oh brought back my Bonny to me, to me.
Brought back, brought back,
Oh brought back my Bonny to me.
"
138,My Boy Willie,"
It was early, early all in the Spring,
That my boy Willie went to serve the King,
The night was dark and the wind blew high;
It was then I lost my dear sailor boy.
2. The night is long and I can find no rest,
The thought of Willie runs in my breast,
I'll search the green woods and village wide,
Still hoping my true love to find.
3. ""Oh, father, father, give me a boat,
Out on the ocean that I may float,
To watch the big boats as they pass by,
That I might enquire for my sailor boy.""

4. She was not long out upon the deep,
When a man-o-war vessel she chanced to meet,
Saying, ""Captain, captain, now tell me true,
If my boy Willie is on board with you.""

5. ""What sort of boy is your Willie dear,
Or what sort of a suit does your Willie wear?""
""He wears a suit of the royal blue,
And you'll easy know him for his heart is true.""

6. ""Oh, then your boy Willie, I am sorry to say,
Has just been drowned the other day,
On yon green island that we pass by,
'Twas there we laid your poor sailor boy.""

7. She wrung her hands and she tore her hair,
And she sobbed and sighed in her despair,
And with every sob she let fall a tear,
And every sigh was for her Willie dear.

8. ""O, father, make my grave both wide and deep,
With a fine tombstone at my head and feet;
And in the middle a turtle dove
That the world may know that I died of love.""

9. Come all you sailors who sail along
And all you boatmen who follow on.
From the cabin-boy to the mainmast high
Ye must mourn in black for my sailor boy.
"
139,My Johnny Is A Shoemaker,"
: My Johnny is a shoemaker
And he has gone to sea :
To reeve the topsail he has gone
Far cross the raging sea.
2. : His jacket is a deep sea blue
And golden is his hair :
This I know and I do declare
My Johnny is a shoemaker.
3. : A captain he’ll be bye and bye
With a brave and a gallant crew :
This I know and I do declare
My Johnny is a shoemaker.

4. : My Johnny is a shoemaker
And he has gone to sea :
To reeve the topsail he has gone
Far cross the raging sea.
"
140,Nancy Lee,"
Of all the wives as e'er you know,
Yeo-ho! lads, ho! Yeo-ho! Yeo-ho!
There's none like Nancy Lee, I trow,
 Yeo-ho! Yeo-ho! Yeo-ho!
See there she stands
And waves her hands
Upon the quay,
And every day
When I'm away
She'll watch for me,
And whisper low
When tempests blow,
For Jack at sea,
Yeo-ho! lads, ho! Yeo-ho!

Chorus:
The sailor's wife the sailor's star shall be,
Yeo-ho! We go across the sea;
The sailor's wife the sailor's star shall be,
The sailor's wife his star shall be!

2. The harbor's past, the breezes blow,
Yeo-ho! lads, ho! Yeo-ho! Yeo-ho!
'Tis long ere we come back, I know.
Yeo-ho! Yeo-ho! Yeo-ho!
But true and bright
From morn till night
My home will be,
And all so neat,
And snug and sweet,
For Jack at sea.
And Nancy's face
To bless the place,
And welcome me.
Yeo-ho! lads, ho! Yeo-ho!
Chorus:

3. The bosun pipes the watch below,
Yeo-ho! lads, ho! Yeo-ho! Yeo-ho!
Then here's a health afore we go,
Yeo-ho! Yeo-ho! Yeo-ho!
A long, long life
To my sweet wife,
And mates at sea,
And keep our bones
From Davy Jones,
Where-e'er we be,
And may you meet
A mate as sweet
As Nancy Lee.
Yeo-ho! lads, ho! Yeo-ho!
Chorus:
"
141,New York Girls,"
As I walked down the Broadway
One evening in July
I met a maid who asked me trade
And a sailor John says I.

To Tiffany's I took her
I did not mind expense
I bought her two gold earrings
And they cost me fifteen cents

Chorus:
And away, you Santee
My dear Annie
O, you New York Girls
Can't you dance the Polka?

2. Says she, ""You Limejuice sailor
Now see me home you may""
But when we reached her cottage door
She this to me did say.

""My flash man he's a Yankee
With his hair cut short behind
He wears a pair of long sea-boots
And he sails in the Blackball Line
Chorus:

3. He's homeward bound this evening
And with me he will stay
So get a move on, sailor-boy
Get cracking on your way""

So I kissed her hard and proper
Afore her flash man came
And fare ye well, me Bowery gal
I know your little game
Chorus:

4. I wrapped me glad rags round me
And to the docks did steer
I'll never court another maid
I'll stick to rum and beer.

I joined a Yankee blood-boat
And sailed away next morn
Don't ever fool around with gals
You're safer off Cape Horn
Chorus:
"
142,The Nobleman's Daughter,"
'Tis of a Nobleman's daughter,
Most beautiful, comely, and fair;
Her father possessed of great fortune,
Of thirty-five thousand a year.
He had but one only daughter,
Caroline was her name, I've been told,
One day, from her drawing-room window,
She admired a young sailor bold.

2. His cheeks were like two roses,
His hair was black as jet.
Young Caroline watched his departure,
Walked round, and young William she met.
She says: I'm a Nobleman's daughter,
Possessed often thousands in gold;
I'll forsake both my father and mother,
And wed with you, young sailor bold.

3. Says William: Young lady, remember,
Your parents you're bound for to mind;
For in sailors there is no dependence,
When their true love is left far behind.
Be advised, and stay home with your parents,
And do by them as you are told,
And never let no one persuade you
To wed with a young sailor bold.

4. She says: There's no one shall persuade me
One moment to alter my mind;
I'll ship, and proceed with my true love--
He never shall leave me behind.
She dressed like a gallant young sailor,
Forsook both her parents and gold;
Two years and a half on the ocean,
She ploughed with her young sailor bold.

5. Three times with her love she was shipwrecked,
And always proved constant and true.
Her duty she did like a sailor,
Went aloft in her jacket so blue.
Her father long weeped and lamented,
From his eyes tears in torrents long rolled,
Till at length they arrived safe in England,
Caroline and her young sailor bold.

6. Caroline went straightway to her father,
In her trowsers and jacket so blue.
Her father he instantly fainted,
When first she appeared to his view
She cries: Dearest father, forgive me,
And forever deprive me of gold;
Grant me one request, I'm contented
To wed with my young sailor bold.

7. Her father admired young William,
And vowed that in sweet unity,
If life did them spare till the morning,
Together they married should be.
They were married; and Caroline's portion
Was ten hundred thousand in gold.
So now they live happy and cheerful,
Caroline and her young sailor bold.

"
143,The Norfolk Girls,"
Our topsails reef'd and filled away,
All snug aloft we know,
Despite the storms we'll still be gay,
Among our friends below.
Come gather round and listen, then,
With spirits warm and true;
Here's a helath to all the Norfolk girls,
And Portsmouth maidens, too.
Chorus:
: Here's a health to all the Norfolk girls,
And Portsmouth maidens, too. :

2. May the darksome eye of loveliness,
And that of ocean's ray,
Shed only tears of happiness
Forever and for aye.
Fill up, tho' far away from home,
And foreign scenes we view,
We cherish still the Norfolk girls,
And the Portsmouth maidens, too.
Chorus:

3. May the cheek whereon reposes
Emotion young and dear,
Still wear the hue of roses
Thro' each succeeding year.
We'll drink to by-past scenes, and hope
Some day again to view,
The lovely girls of Norfolk, and
The Portsmouth maidens, too.
Chorus:

4. And if we never backward go,
Borne home on ocean's breast,
But find among the caves below
A sailor's place of rest;
Still ere we close our eyes and pass
Beneath the depths of blue,
We'll think of all the Norfolk girls,
And Portsmouth maidens, too.
Chorus:

5. Should the foe appear before us,
To our guns we'll fondly cling,
While our stars are gleaming o'er us,
Shall their notes of freedom ring.
While life's warm stream is flowing,
Our eager pulses through,
We'll fight for home, the Norfolk girls,
And Portsmouth maidens, too.
Chorus:

6. Fill up, fill up, yet once again,
Before we say goodnight,
From every glass its sweetness drain,
To friendship's steady light.
May peace around our kindred dwell,
All beings loved and true,
The lovely girls of Norfolk,
And the Portsmouth maidens, too.
Chorus:

7. Good night, good night, our pillows now
With pleasant thoughts we'll press,
And dream some hand rests on our brow,
Its slumbering to bless.
Amid delightful reveries
That fancy brings to view,
Perhaps we'll meet the Norfolk girls,
And Portsmouth maidens, too.
Chorus:
"
144,The Ocean Burial,"
O bury me not in the deep deep sea,
The words came low and mournfully,
From the palled lips of a youth who lay,
On his cabin couch at the close of day,
He had wasted and pined till o'er his brow,
Death's shade had slowly passed, and now
Where the land and his fond loved home were nigh
They had gathered around him to see him die.

2. O bury me not in the deep deep sea,
Where the billowing shroud will swell o'er me,
Where no light will break through the dark cold wave,
And no sun beam rest upon my grave,
It matters not, I have often been told
Where the body shall lie when the heart is cold,
Yet grant, O grant this boon to me,
O bury me not in the deep deep sea.

3. For in fancy I've listened to the well known words,
The free wild winds and the songs of the birds,
I have thought of home, of cot, and of bower,
And of scenes that I loved in childhood's hour,
I had even hoped to be laid when I died,
In the churchyard there on the green hill side,
By the homes of my father my grave should be,
O bury me not in the deep deep sea.

4. Let my death slumbers be where a mother's prayer,
And a sister's tear shall be mingled there,
It will be sweet ere the heart's gentle throb is o'er
To know when its fountain shall gush no more,
That those it so fondly hath yearned for will come,
To plant the first wild flower of spring on my tomb,
Let me lie where those loved ones will weep over me,
O bury me not in the deep deep sea.

5. And there is another whose tears would be shed
For him who lay far in an ocean bed,
In hours that it pains me to think of now,
She hath twined those locks and hath kissed this brow.
In the hair she hath wreathed shall the sea serpent hiss
And the brow she hath pressed shall the cold wave kiss!
For the sake of that bright one that waiteth for me,
O bury me not in the deep deep sea.

6. She hath been in my dreams. His voice failed there,
They gave no heed to his dying prayer,
They have lowered him low o'er the vessel side,
Above him has closed the dark cold tide,
Where to dip the light wings the sea bird rests,
And the blue waves dance o'er the ocean crest,
Where the billows bound and the winds sport free,
They have buried him there in the deep deep sea.

"
146,One of the Roamin' Kind,"
As I went out one evening
Upon a night's career.
I spied a lofty clipper ship'
And to her I did steer.
I hoisted out my signals,
Which she so quickly knew;
For when she saw my bunting fly
She quickly hove to.
Chorus:
She had a dark and a rovin' eye,
And her hair fell down in ringlets
She was a nice girl, a popular girl
But one of the roamin' kind.

2. I took her for some fish and chips
And treated her so fine
And hardly did I realise
She was the roamin'' kind
I kissed her lips, I missed her lips
And found to my surprise
She was nothing but a pirate ship
Rigged out/dressed up in a disguise.
Chorus:

3. Now come all ye good sailor men
Who sail the wintery sea
And come all ye apprentice lads
Fair warning take from me
Beware of lofty clipper ships
They'll be the ruin of you
For 'twas then she made me walk the plank
And pushed me under too.
Chorus:

"
147,On The Seas And Far Away,"
How can my poor heart be glad,
When absent from my sailor lad;
How can I the thought forego-
He's on the seas to meet the foe?
Let me wander, let me rove,
Still my heart is with my love;
Nightly dreams, and thoughts by day,
Are with him that's far away.
On the seas and far away,
On stormy seas and far away;
Nightly dreams and thoughts by day,
Are aye with him that's far away.

2. When in summer noon I faint,
As weary flocks around me pant,
Haply in this scorching sun,
My sailor's thund'ring at his gun;
Bullets, spare my only joy!
Bullets, spare my darling boy!
Fate, do with me what you may,
Spare but him that's far away,
On the seas and far away,
On stormy seas and far away;
Fate, do with me what you may,
Spare but him that's far away.

3. At the starless, midnight hour
When Winter rules with boundless power,
As the storms the forests tear,
And thunders rend the howling air,
Listening to the doubling roar,
Surging on the rocky shore,
All I can-I weep and pray
For his weal that's far away,
On the seas and far away,
On stormy seas and far away;
All I can-I weep and pray,
For his weal that's far away.

4. Peace, thy olive wand extend,
And bid wild War his ravage end,
Man with brother Man to meet,
And as a brother kindly greet;
Then may heav'n with prosperous gales,
Fill my sailor's welcome sails;
To my arms their charge convey,
My dear lad that's far away.
On the seas and far away,
On stormy seas and far away;
To my arms their charge convey,
My dear lad that's far away.
"
148,Paddy Doyle,"
To my,
Aye,
And we'll furl,
Aye,
And pay Paddy Doyle
For his boots.

2. We'll sing,
Aye,
And we'll heave,
Aye,
And we'll hang Paddy Doyle
For his boots.

3. We'll heave,
Aye,
With a swing,
Aye,
And we'll all drink
Brandy and gin.
"
149,Paddy Get Back,"
I was broke and out of a job in the city of London,
I went down to Shadwell Docks to get a ship.
Chorus:
Paddy get back, take in the slack!
Heave away the capstan, heave a pawl! heave a pawl!
'Bout ship and stations and be handy,
Rise tacks and sheets and mains'l haul!

2. There was a Yankee ship a-laying in the basin,
And they told me she was going to New York.
Chorus:

3. If I ever lay my hands on that shipping master,
I'll murder him if it's the last thing I do.
Chorus:

4. When the pilot left the ship 'way down the Channel,
O, the captain told us we were going around Cape Horn.
Chorus:

5. The mate and the second mate belonged in Boston,
And the captain hailed from Bangor down in Maine.
Chorus:

6. The three of them were rough-and-tumble fighters,
When not fighting amongst themselves they turned on us.
Chorus:

7. They called us out one night to reef the topsails,
Now belaying pins were flying around the deck.
Chorus:

8. And we came on deck and went to set the topsails,
Not a man in the bunch could sing a song.
Chorus:

9. We are tinkers, we are tailors, and the fireman also cooks,
And they couldn't sing a shanty unless they had the books.
Chorus:

10. Wasn't that a bunch of hoodlums,
For to take a ship around Cape Horn?
Chorus:
"
150,Paddy West,"
As I was walkin' down London Street,
I come to Paddy West's house,
He gave me a dish of American hash;
He called it Liverpool scouse,
He said ""There's a ship and she's wantin' hands,
And on her you must sign,
The mate's a bastard, the captain's worse,
But she will suit you fine.""
Chorus:
Take off yer dungaree jacket,
And give yerself a rest,
And we'll think on them cold nor'westers
That we had at Paddy West's.

2. When we had finished our dinner,
Boys, the wind began to blow.
Paddy sent me to the attic,
The main-royal for to stow,
But when I got to the attic,
No main-royal could I find,
So I turned myself 'round to the window,
And I furled the window blind.
Chorus:

3. Now Paddy he pipes all hands on deck,
Their stations for to man.
His wife she stood in the doorway,
A bucket in her hand;
And Paddy he cries, ""Now let 'er rip!""
And she throws the water our way,
Cryin' ""Clew in the fore t'gan'sl, boys,
She's takin on the spray!""
Chorus:

4. Now seein' she's bound for the south'ard,
To Frisco she was bound;
Paddy he takes a length of rope,
And he lays it on the ground,
We all steps over, and back again,
And he says to me ""That's fine,
And if ever they ask were you ever at sea
You can say you crossed the line.""
Chorus:

5. To every two men that graduates,
I'll give one outfit free,
For two good men on watch at once,
Ye never need to see,
Oilskins, me boys, ye'll never want,
Carpet slippers made of felt,
I'll dish out to the pair o' you,
And a rope yarn for a belt.
Chorus:

6. Paddy says ""Now pay attention,
These lessons you will learn.
The starboard is where the ship she points,
The right is called the stern,
So look ye aft, to yer starboard port
And you will find northwest.""
And that's the way they teach you
At the school of Paddy West.
Chorus:

7. There's just one thing for you to do
Before you sail away,
Just step around the table,
Where the bullock's horn do lay
And if ever they ask ""Were you ever at sea?""
you can say ""Ten times 'round the Horn""
And  Be Jesus but you're and old sailor man
From the day that you were born.
Chorus:
Put on yer dungaree jacket,
And walk out lookin' yer best,
And tell 'em that you're an old sailor man
That's come from Paddy West's.
"

When Dan O'Connelly went to heaven,
Little Paddy was going on eleven.

I passed my time in the Black Ball Line.
And that's the end of my monkeyshine.

Passant par Paris, vidant la bouteille

8. L'troisième à Paris, qui courtise les belles

9. Et l'père est ici, qui hale la ficelle.

"
153,Pauvre Marinier,"
Voici mon navire qui nage
Il vient en ce havre aborder
Je lui donne toujours sa charge
: De bon vin, si j'en puis trouver. :

2. Les bons garçons de ce rivage
M'attendraillent pour leur en donner
Mais par les pillards et l'orage
: Las ! j'ai tout perdu sur la mer. :

3. Sur la mer sujette à naufrage
Je ne veux plus me hasarder
Des taulpes dessus l'héritage
: J'aime mieux boire et me loger. :

4. Donnez, pour le mettre en courage
A boire au pauvre marinier
Les compagnons du navigage
: Ne les veuillez pas oublier. :
"
154,Pirate Song,"
My boat's by the tower and my bark's on the bay
And both must be gone at the dawn of the day
The moon's in her shroud and to light thee afar
On the deck of the daring's a love-lighted star.
Chorus:
:So wake, lady wake, I am waiting for thee
Oh this night or never my bride thou shalt be:

2. Forgive me rough mood unaccustomed to sue
I woo not perhaps as you landlubbers do
My voice is attuned to the sound of the gun
That startles the deep when teh combat's begun
Chorus:

3. The Frenchmand and Don will flee from our path
And the Englishman cower below at our wrath
And our sails shall be gilt in the gold of the day
And the sea robins sing as we roll on our way.
Chorus:

4. A hundred shall servethe best of the brave -
And the chief of the thousand shall keel as thy slave
And thou shalt reign queen and thy empire shall last
Till the black flag by inches is torn form the mast.
Chorus:
"
155,The Plains of Mexico or Santa Anna,"
O, Santa Anna fought for fame,
Hooray, Santa Anna!
He fought for fame and gained his name,
Along the plains of Mexico!

2. General Taylor gained the day,
Hooray, Santa Anna!
And Santa Anna ran away,
Along the plains of Mexico!"
156,Pleasant And Delightful,"
Twas pleasant and delightful one midsummer's morn
To view the fine meadows all covered with corn
And the blackbirds and thrushes sang on every green spray
And the larks they sang melodious at the dawning of the day
: And the larks they sang melodious :
And the larks they sang melodious at the dawning of the day.

2. A sailor and his true love were walking one day
Said the sailor to his true love ""I'm bound far away
I’m bound for the Indies where load cannons do roar
I must go and leave you Nancy you're the girl I adore
: I must go and leave you Nancy :
I must go and leave you Nancy you're the girl that I adore.

3. The ring from off her finger she instantly drew
Saying ""Take this dearest Willie and me heart will go too""
And as she embraced her tears from her eyes fell
Saying, ""May I go along with you?"" ""Oh no me love farewell""
: Saying, ""May I go along with you?"" :
Saying, ""May I go along with you?"" ""Oh no me love farewell""

4. So fare thee well my dearest Nancy, I'm bound far away
The ship is a-waiting out there in the bay
The anchor is hoisted she waits the next flowing tide
And if ever I return again I will make you my bride
: And if ever I return again :
And if ever I return again I will make you my bride.
"
157,Poor Joe the Marine,"
Poor Joe, the marine, was at Portsmouth well known,
No lad in the corps dress'd so smart;
The lasses ne'er looked at the lad with a frown,
His manliness won every heart.
Sweet Polly at Portsmouth he took for his bride,
And surely there never was seen
A couple so gay march to church, side by side,
As Polly and Joe the marine.

2. The bright torch of Hymen was scarce in a blaze,
When thundering drums they heard rattle;
And Joe in an instant was forc'd to the seas
To give a bold enemy battle.
The action was dreadful, each ship a mere wreck,
Such slaughter few sailors have seen;
Two hundred brave fellows lay strew'd on the deck,
And among them poor Joe the marine.

3. But victory faithful to brave British tars,
At length put an end to the fight;
Then homeward they steer'd, full of glory and scars,
And soon had fam'd Portsmouth in sight.
The ramparts were crowded, the heroes to greet,
And foremost sweet Polly was seen;
But the very first sailor she chanc'd for to meet,
Told the fate of poor Joe the marine.

158,Proud Sally,"
A sailor from Dover, from Dover he came
He courted lovely Sally and Sally was her name;
But still she walked so lofty and her fortune was so high,
That she on a sailor would scarce cast an eye.

2. A few months being over and a few months being past,
This fair she began to grow sick at the last
She grew sick at the last and she couldn't tell for why
And she sent for the sailor that she oftimes did deny.

3. ""Am I the doctor, that you sent for me?
Or am I the young man that you sent for me""?
""Oh yes, you're the doctor, you can either kill or cure,
The pain that I feel, dear, is hard to endure.""

4. ""Where does the pain lie, does it lie in your head?
Or where does the pain lie, does it lie in your side""?
""Oh indeed, young man, you're not far off the guess
The pain that I feel lies under my left breast.""

5. She took the gold rings off her fingers, by one, two or three,
Saying, ""Take you these, dear Willie, in remembrance of me,
In remembrance of me, my dear, when I am dead and gone
And perhaps you'll be sorry then for what you have done.""

6. ""Oh Sally, dearest Sally, oh Sally dear,"" said he
""Don't you remember when you first slighted me?
You mocked me with cruelty and slighted me with scorn
And now I'll reward you for what you have done.""

7. ""Oh Willie, dearest Willie, forget and forgive
And grant me a little while longer to live.""
""O no, dearest Sally, as long as I breathe
I'll dance on your tomb while you lie underneath.""

8. Now Sally's dead and got buried at last,
And Willie's lamenting for all that is past
Saying, ""Sally, lovely Sally, if you were yet alive
It's you I would wed and all others deprive.""

159,Quare Bungle Rye,"
Now Jack was a sailor who roamed on the town,
And she was a damsel who skipped up and down,
Said the damsel to Jack as she passed him by,
""Would you care for to purchase some quare bungle rye, roddy rye?
Fol de diddle rye roddy rye, roddy rye.'

2. Thought Jack to himself 'Now what can this be,
But the finest of whiskey from far Germany,
Smuggled up in a basket and sold on the sly,
And the name that it goes by is quare bungle rye, ruddy rye.
Fol de diddle rye roddy rye, roddy rye.

3. Jack gave her a pound and he thought nothing strange
Said she, ""Hold the basket till I get vou your change""
Jack looked in the basket and a baby did spy,
""Oh Begorrah"", says Jack. ""This is quare bungle rye. roddy rye.
Fol de diddle rye, roddy rye, roddy rye.

4. Now to get the child christened was Jack's first intent,
For to get the child christened to the parson he went.
Says the parson to Jack, ""What will he go by?""
""Bedad now"", says Jack, ""Call him quare bungle rye, roddy rye.
Fol de diddle rye roddy rye, roddy rye.

5. Says the parson to Jack, ""Now that's a queer name"",
Says Jack to the parson, ""It's a queer way he came,
Smuggled up in a basket and sold on the sly,
And the name that he'll go by is Quare Bungle Rye, Roddy Rye.""
Fol de diddle rye roddy rye, roddy rye.

6. Now all you young sailors who roam on the town
Beware of those damsels who skip up and down
Take a look in their baskets as they pass you by,
Or else they might sell you some quare bungle rye, roddy rye.
Fol de diddle rye roddy rye, roddy rye.
"
160,The Queen of Connemara,"
Oh! my boat can swiftly float,
In the teeth of wind and weather.
And out-sail the fastest hooker,
Between Galway and Kinsale.
When the white rim of the ocean
And the wild waves rush together.
Oh, she rides in her pride,
Like a sea bird in a gale.
Refrain:
She's neat, oh, she's sweet,
She's a beauty in every line
The queen of Connemara,
Is this bounding barque of mine.

2. When she's loaded down with fish,
Till the water lips the gunwale
Not a drop she'll take aboard her,
That would wash a fly away.
From the fleet she speeds out quickly,
Like a greyhound from her kennel.
Till she lands her silvery store
The first, on old Kinvara Quay.
Refrain:

3. There's light shines out afar
And it keeps me from dismaying.
When the clouds are ink above us
And the sea runs white with foam.
In a cot in Connemara,
There's a wife and wee ones praying.
To the One Who walked the waters once,
To bring us safely home.
Refrain:
"
161,Ratcliffe Highway,"
As I was a-walking down Wapping
I stepped into Ratcliffe Highway,
And there I went into an alehouse
To spend all that night and next day.

2. Two charming young girls sat beside me,
They asked if I'd money to sport.
""Bring a bottle of wine, change a guinea.
I see you are one of the sort.""

3. The bottle was placed on the table
With glasses for every one;
When I asked for the change of my guinea
She gave me the verse of a song.

4. The old woman she flew in a passion,
And placed her two hands on her hip,
Saying: ""Young man, you don't know our fashion.
You think you're on board of your ship.""

5. ""If that is your fashion, to rob me,
It's a fashion I don't much admire.
So tip me the change of my guinea,
Or a broadside into you I'll fire.""

6. The bottle that stood on the table
I quick at her head did let fly,
And down on the ground she did tumble
And loudly for mercy did cry.

7. The gold watch that hung on the mantel
I into my pocket did slip;
And, darn my old shoes, didn't I trick her,
And soon got aboard of my ship.

8. Our anchor being weighed at our bow, boys,
Our tops'ls being well sheeted home,
We soon bid adieu to fair London,
And all the flash girls in the town.
"
162,Reuben James,"
Have you heard of a ship called the good Reuben James
Manned by hard fighting men both of honor and fame?
She flew the Stars and Stripes of the land of the free
But tonight she's in her grave at the bottom of the sea.
Chorus:
Tell me what were their names, tell me what were their names,
Did you have a friend on the good Reuben James?

2. One hundred men were drowned in that dark watery grave
When that good ship went down only forty-four were saved.
'Twas the last day of October we saved the forty-four
From the cold icy waters off that cold Iceland shore.
Chorus:

3. It was there in the dark of that uncertain night
That we watched for the U-boats and waited for a fight.
Then a whine and a rock and a great explosion roared
And they laid the Reuben James on that cold ocean floor.
Chorus:

4. Now tonight there are lights in our country so bright
In the farms and in the cities they are telling of the fight.
And now our mighty battleships will steam the bounding main
And remember the name of that good Reuben James.
Chorus:
"
163,Reuben Ranzo,"
O, poor old Reuben Ranzo,
Ranzo, boys, Ranzo!
O, pity poor Reuben Ranzo,
Ranzo, boys, Ranzo!

2. O, Ranzo was no sailor,
Ranzo, boys, Ranzo!
He shipped aboard a whaler.
Ranzo, boys, Ranzo!

3. O, Ranzo was no beauty,
Ranzo, boys, Ranzo!
He could not do his duty.
Ranzo, boys, Ranzo!

4. So, they gave him ninety and thirty,
Ranzo, boys, Ranzo!
Yes, lashes nine and thirty.
Ranzo, boys, Ranzo!

5. O, cap'n being a good man,
Ranzo, boys, Ranzo!
He took him to the cabin.
Ranzo, boys, Ranzo!

6. He gave him wine and water,
Ranzo, boys, Ranzo!
Rube kissed the cap'ns daughter.
Ranzo, boys, Ranzo!

7. He taught him navigation,
Ranzo, boys, Ranzo!
To fit him for his station.
Ranzo, boys, Ranzo!

8. Now, Ranzo, he's a sailor,
Ranzo, boys, Ranzo!
Chief mate of that whaler.
Ranzo, boys, Ranzo!

9. He married the cap'ns daughter,
Ranzo, boys, Ranzo!
And sails no more upon the water.
Ranzo, boys, Ranzo!
"

Was you ever in Rio Grande?
Heave away for Rio!
It's there that the river flows down golden sand!
And we're bound for the Rio Grande!
Chorus:
Then away, boys, away,
Away down Rio,
So fare thee well, my pretty young girl,
We're bound for the Rio Grande.

Heave away for Rio!
The girls we are leavin' can have our half-pay.
And we're bound for the Rio Grande!

We've pointed her bow to the southern stars.

"
165,Rolling Down to Old Maui,"
It's a damned tough life, full of toil and strife
We whalermen undergo.
And we don't give a damn when the gale has stopped
How hard the wind did blow.
We're homeward bound! 'Tis a grand old sound
On a good ship taut and free,
And we don't give a damn when we drink our rum
With the girls on old Maui.
Chorus:
Rolling down to old Maui, my boys,
Rolling down to old Maui.
We're homeward bound from the arctic ground
Rolling home to old Maui.

2. Once more we sail with a northerly gale
Through the ice and sleet and rain.
And them coconut fronds in them tropic lands
We soon shall see again.
Six hellish months we've passed away
In the cold Kamchatka sea,
And now we're bound from the arctic ground,
Rolling down to old Maui.
Chorus:

3. We'll heave the lead where old Diamondhead
Looms up on old Oahu.
Our mast and yards are sheathed with ice
And our decks are hid from view.
The horrid tiles of the sea-cut ice
That deck the Arctic Sea
Are miles behind in the frozen wind
Since we steered for old Maui.
Chorus:

4. How soft the breeze of the tropic seas
Now the ice is far astern,
And them native maids in them island glades
Are awaiting our return.
Even now their big black eyes look out
Hoping some fine day to see
Our baggy sails running 'fore the gales
Rolling down to old Maui.
Chorus:

5. And now we sail with a favoring gale
Towards our island home.
Our mainmast sprung, our whaling done,
And we ain't got far to roam.
Our stuns'l booms are carried away
What care we for that sound?
A living gale is after us,
Thank God we're homeward bound!
Chorus:

6. And now we're anchored in the bay
With the Kanakas all around
With chants and soft aloha oes
They greet us homeward bound.
And now ashore we'll have good fun
We'll paint them beaches red
Awaking in the arms of a wahine
With a big fat aching head.
Chorus:
"
166,Rolling Home,"
Up aloft amid the rigging
Swiftly blows the loud favoring gale
Strong as springtime in its blossom,
Filling out each swelling sail
And the waves we leave behind us
Seem to murmur as they rise,
We have tarried here to bear you,
To the land you dearly prize.
Chorus:
Rolling home, rolling home,
Rolling home across the sea;
Rolling home to dear old England
Rolling home, dear land to thee!

2. Full ten thousand miles behind us,
And a thousand miles before,
Ancient ocean waves to waft us
To the well-remembered shore.
Cheer up Jack, bright smiles await you
From the fairest of the fair
And her loving eyes will greet you
With kind welcomes everywhere
Chorus:

3. Call all hands to man the capstan
See the cable run down clear
Heave away and with a will boys
For old England we will steer
And we'll sing in joyful chorus
In the watches of the night
And we'll sight the shores of England
When the grey dawn brings the light
Chorus:"

And a bottle of Irish whiskey, oh.
Chorus:
His bottle, oh, his bottle, oh,
The sailor likes his bottle, oh,

2. Tobaccio, tobaccio,
The sailor loves tobaccio,
A cut of the plug, and a cut of the Swiss,
And a cut of hard tobaccio,
Chorus:

3. The maidens, oh, the lassies, oh,
The sailor loves the Judys, oh,
A gal from Liverpool and a gal from the Tyne
And a lassie so fine and dandy, oh.
Chorus:

4. A bloody rough house, a bloody rough house,
The sailor loves a roughhouse, oh,
A kick in the ass and an all-hands-in,
A bloody good rough-and-tumble, oh,
Chorus:

So early in the morning
The Sailor likes his bottle-o
A bottle o'rum and a bottle o'gin
and a botle  o' Irish whiskey-o
So early in the moring
The Sailor likes his bottle-o

2. So early in the morning
The sailor likes his baccy-o
A packet o' shag and a packet o' twist
and a packet o' Yankee Doodle-o
So early in the morning
The sailor likes his baccy-o

3. So early in the morning
The sailor likes the lasses-o
The lasses o' Blyth and the lesses o' Shields
and the lasses across the water-o
So early in the morning
The sailor likes the lasses-o

Goodbye my feleni, o le a ou lea,
Te folau le va-a o, le Alii pule meleta,
Nei galo mai Apia, si ota ele ele,

181,Sang an Aegir,"
O Aegir, Herr der Fluten
Dem Nix und Neck sich beugt,
In Morgensonneglute
Die Heldenschar sich neigt.
In grimmer fehd' wir fahren
Hin an den fernen Strand,
Durch Sturm, durch Fels und Klippe
Führ' uns in Feindesland.
Will uns der Neck bedräuen,
Versagt uns unser Schild,
So wehr' dein flammend Auge
Dem Ansturm noch so wild !
Wie Frithjof auf Ellida
Getrost durfuhr dein Meer
So schirm' von diesem Drachen
Uns, deiner Söhne Heer !
Wenn in dem wilden Horste
Sich Brünn und Brünne drängt,
Den Feind, vom Stahl getroffen,
Die Schildesmaid umfängt,
Dann töne hin zum Meere
Mit Schwert und Schildesklang,
Dir, hoher Gott zu Ehre,
Wie Sturmwind unser Sang.
"
182,The Sea Is England's Glory,"
The sea is England's glory!
The bounding waves her throne;
For ages bright in story,
The ocean is her own.
In war the first, the fearless
Her standard leads the brave,
In peace she reigns so peerless,
The Empress of the wave!

2. The sea is England's splendour!
Her wealth the mighty main;
She is the world's defender;
The humble to sustain;
Her gallant sons in story
Stand bravest of the brave,
Oh! England's strength and glory
Are on her ocean wave!

3. Thou loveliest land of beauty!
Where dwells domestic worth,
Where loyalty and duty
Entwine each heart and hearth!
Thy rock is freedom's pillow
The rampart of the brave,
Oh! long as rolls the billow,
Shall England rule the wave!
"
183,Serafina,"
In Callao there lives a gal
Whose name is Serafina
Serafina! Serafina!
She sleeps all day and 'works' all night
On the old Cally Marina
Serafina! Oh, Serafina!

2. She's the queen, me boys, of all the gals
That live in the ole' Casino,
Serafina! Serafina!
She used to 'kiss' for monkey nuts
But now she 'works' for vino.

She'll make you pay right through the nose,
That lovely Serafina!
Serafina! Oh, Serafina!

4. She'll guzzle pisco, beer and gin,
On rum her mum did wean her
Serafina! Serafina!
She smokes just like a chimney stack
On a P.S.N.C steamer.
Serafina! Oh, Serafina!

5. Serafina's got no 'shoes',

Serafina! Serafina!
She's got no time to put them on,
That hard-worked Serafina.

Was little Serafina,

Who plays a concertina.

"
185,The Shannon and the Chesapeake,"
Now the Cheasapeake so bold
Sailed from Boston we've been told,
For to take the British frigate neat and handy, O!
The people in the port
All came out to see the sport,
And the bands were playing ""Yankee Doodle Dandy, O!""

2. The British frigate's name,
Which for the purpose came
To cool the Yankee courage and handy-o,
Was the ShannonCaptain Broke,
All her men were hearts of oak.
And at fighting were allowed to be dandy-o.

3. The fight had scarce begun
Ere they flinched from their guns,
Which at first they started working neat and handy-o.
Then brave Broke he waved his sword,
Crying, ""Now, my lads, aboard,
And we'll stop their playing 'Yankee Doodle Dandy-O.'""

4. They no sooner heard the word,
Than they quickly jumped aboard,
And hauled down the Yankee colors neat and handy-o;
Notwithstanding all their brag,
Now the glorious British flag
At the Yankee mizzen peak was quite the dandy-o.

5. Here's a health, brave Broke, to you,
To your officers and crew,
Who aboard the Shannon frigate fought so handy-o;
And may it always prove,
That in fighting and in love,
The British tar forever is the dandy-o.
"
186,Shenandoah,"
O Shenandoah! I long to hear you,

'cross the wide Missouri!

O Shenandoah, I love your daughter
Way-aye, you rolling river
I'll take her 'cross yon rolling water
Away, we're bound away
'cross the wide Missouri!

For seven years I courted Sally,
Way-aye, you rolling river
For seven more I longed to have her
Away, we're bound away
'cross the wide Missouri!

She said she would not be my lover
Way-aye, you rolling river
Because I was a tarry sailor
Away, we're bound away
'cross the wide Missouri!

At last there came a Yankee skipper
Way-aye, you rolling river
He winked his eye, and he tipped his flipper
Away, we're bound away
'cross the wide Missouri

"
187,The Shoals Of Herring,"
With our nets and gear we’re faring
O’er the wild and wasteful ocean
It’s there on the deep that we harvest and reap our bread
As we hunt the bonny shoals of herring.

2. It was on a fine and a pleasant day
Out of Yarmouth harbour I was faring
As a cabin boy on a sailing lugger
For to go and hunt the shoals of herring.

3. Now the work was hard and the hours were long
And the treatment sure it took some bearing
Her was little kindness and the kicks were many
As we hunted for the shoals of herring.

4. Oh we fished the Swarth and the Dogger Bank
I was cook and I’d a quarter-sharing
And I used to sleep standing on me feet
And I’d dream about the shoals of herring.

5. Oh! We left the home grounds in the month of June
And for canny Shiels we soon were bearing
With a hundred cran of the silver darling
That we’d taken from the shoals of herring.

6. Now you’re up on deck you’re a fisherman
You can swear and show a manly bearing
Take your turn on watch with the other fellows
While you’re searching for shoals of herring.

7. In the stormy seas and the living gale
Just to earn your daily bread you’re daring
From the Dover Straits to the Faeroe Islands
As you’re following the shoals of herring.

8. Oh I earned my keep and I paid me way
And I earned the gear that I was wearing
Sailed a million miles, caught ten million fishes
We were sailing after shoals of herring.
"
188,Sir Richard Grenville's Farewell,"
Who seeks the way to win renown,
Or flies with wings of his desire;
Who seeks to wear the laureate crown,
Or hath the mind that would aspire:
Let him his native soil eschew,
Let him go range and seek anew.

2. Each haughty heart is well content
With every chance that shall betide;
No hap can hinder his intent:
He steadfast stands, though fortune slide.
The sun, quoth he, doth shine as well
Abroad as erst where I did dwell.

3. In change of streams each fish can live,
Each fowl content with every air;
Each haughty heart remaineth still,
And not be drowned in deep despair:
Wherefore I judge all lands alike
To haughty hearts who fortune seek.

4. To pass the seas some think a toil,
Some think it strange abroad to roam;
Some think it a grief to leave their soil,
Their parents, kinfolks, and their home.
Think so who list, I like it not:
I must abroad to try my lot.

5. Who lists at home at cart to drudge,
And cark and care for worldly trash,
With buckled shoes let him go trudge,
Instead of lance or whip to slash:
A mind that base his kind will show
Of carrion sweet to feed a crow.

6. If Jason of that mind had been,
The Grecians when they came to Troy
Had never so the Trojans foiled,
Nor never put them to such annoy:
Wherefore who lust may live at home.
To purchase fame I will go roam."
189,Song of the Fishes,"
Come all you bold fishermen, listen to me,
While I sing to you a song of the sea.
Chorus:
Then blow ye winds westerly, westerly blow,
We're bound to the southward, so steady we go.

2. First comes the blue-fish a-wagging his tail,
He come up on the deck and yells: ""All hands make sail!""
Chorus:

3. Next comes the eels, with their nimble tails,
They jumped up aloft and loosed all the sails.
Chorus:

4. Next come the herrings, with their little tails,
The manned sheets and halliards and set all the sails.
Chorus:

5. Next comes the porpoise, with his short snout,
He jumps on the bridge and yells: ""Ready, about!""
Chorus:

6. Next comes the swordfish, the scourge of the sea,
The order he gives is ""Helm's a-lee!""
Chorus:

7. Then comes the turbot, as red as a beet,
He shouts from the bridge: ""Stick out that foresheet!""
Chorus:

8. Having accomplished these wonderful feats,
The blackfish sings out next to: ""Rise tacks and sheet!""
Chorus:

9. Next comes the whale, the largest of all,
Singing out from the bridge: ""Haul taut, mainsail, haul!""
Chorus:

10. Then comes the mackerel, with his striped back,
He flopped on the bridge and yelled: ""Board the main tack!""
Chorus:

11. Next comes the sprat, the smallest of all,
He sings out: ""Haul well taut, let go and haul!""
Chorus:

12. Then comes the catfish, with his chuckle had,
Out in the main chains for a heave of the lead.
Chorus:

13. Next comes the flounder, quite fresh from the ground,
Crying: ""Damn your eyes, chucklehead, mind where you sound!""
Chorus:

14. Along came a dolphin, flapping his tail,
He yelled to the boatswain to reef the foresail.
Chorus:

15. Along came the shark, with his three rows of teeth,
He flops on the foreyard and takes a snug reef.
Chorus:

16. Up jumps the fisherman, stalwart and grim,
And with his big net he scooped them all in.
Chorus:
"
190,South Australia,"
In South Australia I was born
To me heave away, haul away
In South Australia round Cape Horn
Chorus
We're bound for South Australia
Haul away you rolling kings
To me heave away, haul away
Haul away, you'll hear me sing
We're bound for South Australia

2. As I walked out one morning fair
To me heave away, haul away
'Twas there I met Miss Nancy Blair
Chorus

3. I shook her up and I shook her down
To me heave away, haul away
I shook her round and round the town
Chorus

4. I run her all night and I run her all day
To me heave away, haul away
And I run her until we sailed away
Chorus

5. There ain't but one thing grieves me mind
To me heave away, haul away
To leave Miss Nancy Blair behind
Chorus

6. And as we wallop around Cape Horn
To me heave away, haul away
You'll wish to God you'd never been born
Chorus

7. In South Australia my native land
To me heave away, haul away
Full of rocks and thieves and fleas and sand
Chorus

8. I wish I was on Australia's strand
To me heave away, haul away
With a bottle of whiskey in my hand
Chorus"
191,Spanish Ladies,"
Farewell and adieu to you, Spanish ladies,
Farwell and adieu to you, ladies of Spain;
For we've received orders for to sail to old England;
But we hope in a short time to see you again.

2. *We'll rant and we'll roar like true British sailors,
We'll rant and we'll roar across the salt seas,
Until we strike soundings in the channel of old England,
From Ushant to Scilly is thirty five leagues.

3. Then we hove our ship to with the wind at sou'west, boys,
We hove our ship to, for to strike soundings clear;
We got soundings in ninety-five fathom, and boldly
Up the channel of old England our course we did steer.

4. Now the first land we made it is called the Deadman,
Then, Ramshead off Plymouth, Start, Portland, and Wight;
We passed by Beechy, by Fairleigh and Dungeness,
And hove our ship to, off South Foreland Light.

5. Then a signal was made for the grand fleet to anchor,
All in the Downs, that night for to meet
Then stand by your stoppers, let go your shank-painters,
Haul all your clew garnets, stick out tacks and sheets.

6. Now let every man drink off his full bumper
Let every man toss off his full bowls;
We'll drink and be jolly, and drown melancholy,
So here's a good health to all true-hearted souls!

"
192,Stand To Your Guns!,"
Stand to your guns! my hearts of oak,
Let not a word on board be spoke,
Victory soon will crown the joke;
Be silent and be ready.
Ram home your guns and sponge them well,
Let us be sure, the balls will tell,
The cannon's roar shall sound their knell,
Be steady, boys, be steady.
Not yet, nor yet, nor yet.
Reserve your fire,
I do desire, fire!

Now, the elements do rattle,
The Gods amaz'd behold the battle
A broadside, my boys.
See the blood in purple tide,
Trickle down her batter'd side,
Wing'd with fate the bullets fly,
Conquer, boys, or bravely die!
Hurl destruction on your foes!
She sinks, Huzza! to the bottom,
To the bottom down she goes!
"
193,Stately Southerner,"
'Tis of a stately Southerner
Who flew the Stripes and Stars
The whistling wind from west nor'west
Blew through our pitch-pine spars
We had our larboard tacks on board
As we hung upon a gale,
Geble Island light shone bright
From the Old Head of Kinsale.

2. No thought was there of shortening sail
By him who trod our poop,
Although the press of our pondering jibs,
The boom bends like a hoop;
Our groaning chess-trees told the strain
That stood on our stout main tack
But he only laughed as he glanced abaft
At the white and glistening track.

3. It was a bright and a cloudless night,
The wind blew fresh and strong
As gaily o'er the Channel wave
Our good ship swept along.
With the foaming sea before her bow
The briny wave she spread
Till bending low in a foam like snow
She buries her lee cathead.

4. ""What's this upon our weather bow
What ship is this I see?
It's time our good ship hauled her wind,
We're abreast the old Saltee""
'Twas by the nightly robe she wore
And her tap'ring length of spar
We knew our morning visitor
Was a British man-o'-war.

5. What did our daring foeman do?
A shot ahead he passed,
Clewed up his flowing courses,
Laid his topsails to the mast.
Those British tars gave three huzzas
From the deck of their black corvette
But we answered back with a scornful laugh
As our starry flag we set.

6. ""Out booms, out booms!"" cried the Southerner.
""Out booms, and give her sheet.
Here comes the fastest man-o'-war
Of all the Channel fieet.
She's bearing down upon us, boys,
With the white foam at her bow
Out booms, out booms!"" cried the Southerner.
""Don't spare your canvas now!""

7. The midtide meets the Channel wave
That flows from shore to shore
The mist hung heavy o'er the land
From Featherstone to Dunmore;
The day star glinted in the east,
Four bells had rolled the hour,
And the sterling light on Tuskar Rock
Was quenched in the Waterford Tower.

8. Out spake our noble captain then,
Not a cloud was on his brow:
""Stand by, my gallant heroes all,
The enemy's on us now.
We carry aloft the Stars and Stripes
Against old England's boast.
Paul Jones, the terror of the sea,
Will fly them on her coast!""

9. The fog was rising o'er the land,
The wind was from the shore,
And the poor Dungarven fishernen
Sought shelter in Kinsore.
With light sails set and booms rigged out
And stun's'ls hoisted away
Paul Jones did clear the Channel mouth
Before the dawn of day.
"
194,Stormalong,"
O, Stormy's gone, that good old man,
To my way hay, Stormalong, John!
O, poor old Stormy's dead and gone,
To my aye, aye, aye, aye, Mister Stormalong!

2. We dug his grave with a silver spade,
To my way hay, Stormalong, John!
His shroud of the finest silk was made.
To my aye, aye, aye, aye, Mister Stormalong!

3. We lowered him with a silver chain,
To my way hay, Stormalong, John!
Our eyes all dim with more than rain.
To my aye, aye, aye, aye, Mister Stormalong!

4. An able sailor, bold and true,
To my way hay, Stormalong, John!
A good old bosun to his crew.
To my aye, aye, aye, aye, Mister Stormalong!

5. He's moored at last, and furled his sail,
To my way hay, Stormalong, John!
No danger now from wreck or gale.
To my aye, aye, aye, aye, Mister Stormalong!

6. I wish I was old Stormy's son,
To my way hay, Stormalong, John!
I'd build me a ship of a thousand ton.
To my aye, aye, aye, aye, Mister Stormalong!

7. I'd fill her up with New England rum,
To my way hay, Stormalong, John!
And all my shellbacks they would have some.
To my aye, aye, aye, aye, Mister Stormalong!

8. I'd sail this wide world 'round and 'round,
To my way hay, Stormalong, John!
With plenty of money I would be found.
To my aye, aye, aye, aye, Mister Stormalong!

9. Old Stormy's dead and gone to rest,
To my way hay, Stormalong, John!
Of all the sailors he was the best,
To my aye, aye, aye, aye, Mister Stormalong!
"
195,Stormy Weather Boys,"
We're laying in Surrey Dock one day,
When the mate told us to get under way.
Refrain:
Stormy weather boys, stormy weather boys,
When the wind blows, our barge will go.

2. He's homeward bound but he's out of luck,
'Cause the skipper's half drunk in the Dog and Duck.
Refrain:

3. Then the skipper came aboard with a girl on his arm,
He's going to give up barging and take a farm.
Refrain:

4. So the mate ran forward and the cook fell in the dock,
And the skipper caught his knackers in the mainsheet block.
Refrain:

5. We shored her off and away did go,
But the skipper's got a bottle of beer below.
Refrain:

6. She fills away and she sails like heck
But there ain't no bargemen up on deck.
Refrain:

7. Then up comes a mermaid, covered in mud,
So we took her down in the fo'csle and had a good time.
Refrain:
"
196,Strike the Bell,"
Up on the poop deck and walking about,
There is the second mate so steady and so stout;
What he is a-thinkin' of he doesn't know himself
And we wish that he would hurry up and strike, strike the bell.
Chorus:
Strike the bell second mate, let us go below;
Look well to windward you can see it's gonna blow;
Look at the glass, you can see it has fell,
Oh we wish that you would hurry up and strike, strike the bell.

2. Down on the main deck and workin' at the pumps,
There is the larboard watch just longing for their bunks;
Look out to windward, you can see a great swell,
And we wish that you would hurry up and strike, strike the bell.
Chorus:

3. Forward on the forecastle head and keepin' sharp lookout,
There is Johnny standin', a-longin' fer to shout,
Lights' a-burnin' bright sir and everything is well,
And he's wishin' that the second mate would strike, strike the bell.
Chorus:

4. Aft at the wheelhouse old Anderson stands,
Graspin' at the helm with his frostbitten hands,
Lookin' at the compass through the course is clear as hell
And he's wishin' that the second mate would strike, strike the bell.
Chorus:

5. Aft on the quarter deck our gallant captain stands,
Lookin' out to windward with a spyglass in his hand,
What he is a-thinkin' of we know very well,
He's thinkin' more of shortenin' sail than strikin' the bell.
Chorus:
"
197,Ten Thousand Miles,"
O fare you well, my own true love,
So fare you well for a while
I'm going away, but I'm coming back
If I go ten thousand miles.

If I prove false to you, my love
The earth may melt and burn
The sea may freeze and the earth may burn
If I no more return.

Ten thousand miles, my own true love
Ten thousand miles or more
The rocks may melt and the seas may burn
If I no more return.

And who will shoe your pretty feet
Or who will glove your hand
Or who will kiss your red rosy cheek
When I'm in the foreign land.

My father will shoe my pretty little feet
My mother will glove my hand
And you can kiss my red, rosy cheek
When you return again.

O don't you see yon little turtle dove
A-skipping from vine to vine
A-mourning the loss of her own true love
Just as I mourn for mine.

Don't you see yon pretty little girl
A-spinning on yonder wheel
Ten thousand gay gold guineas would I give
To feel just like she feels..

"
198,Ten Thousand Miles Away,"
Sing ho! for a brave an' a gallant ship,
An' a fast an' fav'rin' breeze,
Wi' a bully crew an' a cap'n to
To carry me over the seas;
To carry me over the seas, me boys,
To me true love far away,
For I'm takin' a trip on a Government ship
Ten thousand miles away.
Chorus:
Then blow, ye winds and blow!
An' a-rovin' I will go.
I'll stay no more on England's shore
To hear sweet music play
For I'm on the move to me own true love
Ten thousand miles away.

2. My true love wuz beautiful,
An' my true love wuz gay,
But she's taken a trip on a Government ship
Bound out to Botany Bay,
Bound out to Botany Bay, m'boys,
An' though she's far away,
I'll never forget me own true love,
Ten thousand miles away!
Chorus:

3. Oh, it wuz a summer's mornin',
When last I saw my Meg
She'd a Government band around each hand
An' another one round her leg
Oh, another one round her leg, m'boys
As the big ship left the bay,
""Adieu,"" she sez, ""remember me,
Ten thousand miles away!""
Chorus:

4. I wish I wuz a bosun bold
Or a sailor widout fear
I'd man a boat and away I'd float
An' straight for me true love steer;
An' straight for me true love steer, m'boys
Where the whales an' dolphins play,
Where the whales an' sharks are havin' their larks
Ten thousand miles away.
Chorus:

5. Oh, the sun may shine through the London fog
Or the river run quite clear,
Or the ocean brine turn into wine
Or I forget my beer
Or I forget my beer, m'boys
Or the landlord's quarter-pay
But I'll never forget me own true love
Ten thousand miles away.
Chorus:"
199,Three Score and Ten,"
Refrain:
And it's three score and ten
Boys and men were lost from Grimsby Town
From Yarmouth down to Scarborough
Many hundreds more were drowned
Their herring craft and trawlers
Their fishing smacks as well
Alone they fight the bitter night
And battle with the swell.

Me thinks I see a host of craft,
Spreading their sails at lee
As down the Humber they do steer,
Down for the great North Sea
Me thinks I see a wee small craft
And crew with hearts so brave
They go to earn their daily bread
Upon the restless waves.
Refrain:

2. Me thinks I see them yet again,
As they leave this land behind
Casting their nets into the sea,
The herring shoals to find
Me thinks I see them yet again,
And they save on board a right
With their sails close-reefed, their decks moist-cleaned
And their side-lights burning bright.
Refrain:

3. October's night brought such a sight,
'Twas never seen before
There were masts and yards and broken spars,
Washed up upon the shore
There was many a heart of sorrow,
There was many a heart so brave
There was many a true and noble lad
To find a watery grave.
Refrain:
"
200,Time to Leave Her,"
O, the work was hard and the wages low,
Leave her, Johnny, leave her!
We'll pack our bags and go below,
It's time for us to leave her!

2. The work was hard, the voyage was long,
Leave her, Johnny, leave her!
The seas were high, the gales were strong.
It's time for us to leave her!

3. The food was bad and the ship was slow,
Leave her, Johnny, leave her!
But now ashore again we'll go.
It's time for us to leave her!

4. It was growl you my but go you must,
Leave her, Johnny, leave her!
It mattered not whether you're last or first.
It's time for us to leave her!

5. I thought I heard the old man say,
Leave her, Johnny, leave her!
""Just one more pull and then belay.""
It's time for us to leave her!

6. The sails are furled, our work is done,
Leave her, Johnny, leave her!
And now on shore we'll have our fun.
It's time for us to leave her!
"
201,The Token,"
The breeze was fresh, the ship was in stays,
Each breaker hush'd, the shore a haze,
When Jack, no more on duty call'd
His true love's tokens over haul'd;
The broken gold, the braided hair,
The tender motto, writ so fair,
Upon his 'bacco box he views,
Nancy the poet, love the muse,
Chorus:
If you loves I as I loves you,
No pair so happy as we two.

2. The storm, that like the shapeless wreck
Had strew'd with rigging all the deck,
That tars for sharks had giv'n a feast,
And left the ship a hulk had ceas'd:
When Jack, as with his messmates dear.
He shar'd the grog their hearts to cheer,
Took from his 'bacco box a quid,
And spell'd for comfort on the lid,
Chorus:

3. The battlethat with horror grim
Had madly ravag'd life and limb,
Had scupper drenched with human gore
And widow'd many a wifewas o'er:
When Jack to his companions dear
First paid the tribute of a tear;
Then, as his 'bacco-box he held,
Restor'd his comfort as he spelled
Chorus:

4. The voyage,that had been long and hard,
But that had yielded full reward,
And bought each sailor to his friend
Happy and richwas at an end:
When Jack, his toils and perils o'er,
Beheld his Nancy on the shore:
He then the 'bacco box display'd,
And cried, and seized the yielding maid,
Chorus:
"
202,Tommy's Gone to Hilo,"
O, Tommy's gone, what shall I do?
Hey-yay to Hilo!
O, Tommy's gone, and I'll go too.
Tommy's gone to Hilo!

2. O, I love Tom and he loves me,
Hey-yay to Hilo!
He thinks of me when out to sea.
Tommy's gone to Hilo!

3. O, away around to Callao,
Hey-yay to Hilo!
The Spanish girls he'll see, I know.
Tommy's gone to Hilo!

4. O, Tommy's gone forevermore,
Hey-yay to Hilo!
I'll never see my Tom no more.
Tommy's gone to Hilo!"
203,Tom Bowline,"
Here, a sheer hulk, lies poor Tom Bowline,
The darling of our crew;
No more he'll hear the tempest howling,
For death has broach'd him to.
His form was of the manliest beauty,
His heart was kind and soft;
Faithful below, he did his duty,
And now he's gone aloft.

2. Tom never from his word departed,
His virtues were so rare,
His friends were many, and true-hearted,
His Poll was kind and fair:
And then he'd sing so blithe and jolly,
Ah, many's the time and oft!
But mirth is turned to melancholy,
For Tom is gone aloft.

3. Yet shall poor Tom find pleasant weather,
When He, who all commands,
Shall give, to call life's crew together,
The word to pipe all hands.
Thus Death, who kings and tars dispatches,
In vain Tom's life has doff'd,
For, though his body's under hatches,
His soul has gone aloft.
"
204,Topman and the Afterguard,"
The topman and the afterguard were walking one day,
Said the topman to the afterguard, I mean for to pray,
For the rights of all sailors and the wrongs of all men,
And whatever I do pray for you must answer Amen.
Says the afterguard ""Amen.""

2. First I'll pray for the bosun with his little stick,
He calls out all hands then gives us a lick,
Strikes many a brave fellow then kicks him a-main,
May the Devil double triple damn him.
Says the afterguard ""Amen.""

3. Next I'll pray for the Purser who gives us to eat,
Spew-burgers rank butter and musty horsemeat,
With weevily biscuit while he gets the gain,
May the Devil double triple damn him.
Says the afterguard ""Amen.""

4. Then I'll pray for them navy officers who hold back our due,
We are owed three years wages and prize money too,
Well it's no pay for you Jack try next voyage again,
May the Devil double triple damn them.
Says the afterguard ""Amen.""

5. Well the last thing that I'll pray for is a drop of good beer,
For the Lord made the liquor our spirits for to cheer,
And where we had one pot I wish we had ten,
And never never want for grog my boys.
Said the afterguard ""Amen.""
"
205,The Unfortunate Miss Bailey,"
A captain bold from Halifax
Once left his captain quarters,
Seduced a maid who hanged herself
One morning in her garters.
His wicked conscience smitted him,
He lost his stomach daily,
He took to drinking turpentine
And thought upon Miss Bailey.
: Oh! Miss Bailey, unfortunate Miss Bailey! :

2. One night while sleeping on his ship,
The captain heard a banging,
He left his bed and went on deck,
And saw Miss Bailey hanging.
His timepiece stopped at Midnight
And his candle burned quite palely.
And from the mast a ghost stepped down,
Behold it was Miss Bailey.
: Oh! Miss Bailey, unfortunate Miss Bailey! :

3. Away, Miss Bailey, he implored,
You don't affright me, really,
Dear Captain Smith, the ghost replied,
You've used me ungenteely.
The coroner was hard on me,
Because I acted fraily,
The Parson would not bury me,
Though I'm a dead Miss Bailey.
: Oh! Miss Bailey, unfortunate Miss Bailey! :

4. You won't believe me when I say,
The captain got soft-hearted.
He gave the ghost a five-pound note,
With which she then departed.
'Twill bribe the sexton for my grave,
And so I leave thee gaily,
Oh bless you, wicked Captain Smith,
For rescuing Miss Bailey.
"
206,Warlike Seamen,"
Come all you warlike seamen that to the seas belong,
I'll tell you of a fight my boys on board the Nottingham,
It's of a Irish captain his name was Somerville,
With courage bold did he control he played his part full well.

2. It was on the Eighth of June my boys when at Spithead we lay,
On board there came an order our anchor for to weigh,
Bound for the coast of Ireland our orders did run so,
There to cruise and not refuse against our daring foe.

3. We had not sailed many lengths at sea before a ship we spied,
She being some lofty Frenchman come a-bearing down so wide,
She hailed us in French my boys and asked from where we came,
Our answer was from Liverpool and London is our name.

4. Oh pray are you some man of war oh pray what may you be,
Oh then replied our captain oh that you soon shall see,
Come strike your English colours or else you shall bring to,
Since you're so stout you shall give out or else we will sink you.

5. The first broadside we gave to them it made them for to wonder,
Their rigging and their mainmast came a-rattling down like thunder,
We drove them to their quarter they could no longer stay,
Our guns did roar we made so sure we showed them British play.

6. So now we've took that ship my boys God speed us fair wind,
That we might sail to Plymouth town if the heavens prove so kind,
We'll drink a health unto our captain and all such warlike souls,
To him we'll drink and never flinch out of our flowing bowl.
"
207,We're All Bound to Go,"
O, as I walked down the Landing Stage,
All on a Summer's morn,
Heave away, my Johnny, heave away!
It's there I spied an Irish girl
A-looking all forlorn.
And away, my Johnny boys,
We're all bound to go!

2. ""O, good morning, Mr. Tapscott,
Good morning, my girl,"" says he,
Heave away, my Johnny, heave away!
""Have you got a packet ship
To carry me across the sea?""
And away, my Johnny boys,
We're all bound to go!

3. ""O, yes, I have a clipper ship,
She's called the Henry Clay;""
Heave away, my Johnny, heave away!
""She sails today for Boston Bay,
She sails away at break of day.""
And away, my Johnny boys,
We're all bound to go!

4. ""O, will you take me to Boston Bay,
When she sails away at break of day?""
Heave away, my Johnny, heave away!
""I want to marry a Yankee boy,
And I'll cross the sea no more.""
And away, my Johnny boys,
We're all bound to go!
"
208,A Wet Sheet and A Flowing Sea,"
A wet sheet and a flowing sea,
A wind that follows fast,
And fills the white and rustling sail,
And bends the gallant mast,
And bends the gallant mast, my boys!
While like an eagle free,
Away the good ship flies,
And leaves Columbia on our lee.
Chorus:
Oh! Give me a wet sheet, a flowing sea,
And a wind that follows fast,
And fills the white and rustling sail
And bends the gallant mast.

2. Oh, for a soft and gentle wind,
I heard a fair one cry,
But give to me the roaring breeze,
And the white waves heaving high;
And white waves heaving high, my boys!
The good ship tight and free;
The world of waters is our home,
And merry men are we.
Chorus:

3. There's a tempest in yon horned moon,
And lightning in yon cloud,
And hard the music, mariners,
The wind is piping loud;
The wind is piping loud, my boys!
The lightning flashes free,
While the hollow oak our palace is,
Our heritage the sea.
Chorus:"
209,We Be Three Poor Mariners,"
We be three poor mariners,
Newly come from the seas,
We spend our lives in jeopardy,
While others live at ease.
: Shall we go dance the Round, around, around? :
And he that is a bully boy,
Come, pledge me on this ground, aground, aground!

2. We care not for those martial men
That do our states disdain;
But we care for those merchantmen
That do our states maintain.
: Shall we go dance the Round, around, around? :
And he that is a bully boy,
Come, pledge me on this ground, aground, aground!

210,The Whale,"
It was in the year of forty four,
In March the second day,
That our gallant ship her anchors weighed,
And for the sea they bore away,
Brave boys,
And for sea they bore away.

2. And when we came to far Greenland,
And to Greenland cold we came,
Where there's frost and snow
And the whalefishes blow,
Brave boys,
And the whalefishes blow.

3. Our bosun went to topmast high
With his spyglass in his hand.
""A whale! There's a whalefish,"" he cried,
""And she blows at every span,
Brave boys,
She blows at every span.""

4. Our captain stood on the quarterdeck,
And a brave little man was he.
""Overhaul, overhaul, on your davit tackles fall
And launch your boats for sea,
Brave boys,
And launch your boats for sea.""

5. We struck the whale, away he went,
And he lashed out with his tail,
And we lost the boat and five good men,
And we never got the whale,
Brave boys,
And we did not get that whale.

6. O, Greenland is an awful place,
Where the daylight's seldom seen,
Where there's frost and snow,
And the whalefishes blow,
Brave boys,
And the whalefishes blow.

212,When I Was a Lad,"
When I was a lad I served a term
As office boy to an Attorney's firm.
I cleaned the windows and I swept the floor,
And I polished up the handle of the big front door.
He polished up the handle of the big front door.
I polished up that handle so carefullee
That now I am the Ruler of the Queen's Navee!
He polished up that handle so carefullee,
That now he is the ruler of the Queen's Navee.

2. As office boy I made such a mark
That they gave me the post of a junior clerk.
I served the writs with a smile so bland,
And I copied all the letters in a big round hand--
He copied all the letters in a big round hand.
I copied all the letters in a hand so free,
That now I am the Ruler of the Queen's Navee!
He copied all the letters in a hand so free,
That now he is the Ruler of the Queen's Navee! 

3. In serving writs I made such a name
That an articled clerk I soon became;
I wore clean collars and a brand-new suit
For the pass examination at the Institute,
For the pass examination at the Institute.
And that pass examination did so well for me,
That now I am the Ruler of the Queen's Navee!
That pass examination did so well for he,
That now he is the Ruler of the Queen's Navee!

4. Of legal knowledge I acquired such a grip
That they took me into the partnership.
And that junior partnership, I ween,
Was the only ship that I ever had seen.
Was the only ship that he ever had seen.
But that kind of ship so suited me,
That now I am the Ruler of the Queen's Navee!
But that kind of ship so suited he,
That now he is the ruler of the Queen's Navee!

5. I grew so rich that I was sent
By a pocket borough into Parliament.
I always voted at my party's call,
And I never thought of thinking for myself at all.
He never thought of thinking for himself at all.
I thought so little, they rewarded me
By making me the Ruler of the Queen's Navee!
He thought so little, they rewarded he
By making him the Ruler of the Queen's Navee!

6. Now landsmen all, whoever you may be,
If you want to rise to the top of the tree,
If your soul isn't fettered to an office stool,
Be careful to be guided by this golden rule
Be careful to be guided by this golden rule.
Stick close to your desks and never go to sea,
And you all may be rulers of the Queen's Navee!
Stick close to your desks and never go to sea,
And you all may be rulers of the Queen's Navee!

"
217,Why Should We Quarrel For Riches,"
How pleasant a sailor's life passes,
Who roams o'er the watery main!
No treasure he ever amasses,
But cheerfully spends all his gain.
We're strangers to party and faction,
To honour and honesty true;
And would not commit a bad action
For power or profit in view.
Refrain:
Then why should we quarrel for riches,
Or any such glittering toys;
A light heart, and a thin pair of breeches,
Will go through the world, my brave boys!

2. The world is a beautiful garden,
Enriched with the blessings of life,
The toiler with plenty rewarding,
Which plenty too often breeds strife.
When terrible tempests assail us,
And mountainous billows affright,
No grandeur or wealth can avail us,
But skilful industry steers right.
Refrain:

3. The courtier's more subject to dangers,
Who rules at the helm of the state,
Than we that, to politics strangers,
Escape the snares laid for the great.
The various blessings of nature,
In various nations we try;
No mortals than us can be greater,
Who merrily live till we die.
Refrain:
"
218,Ye Mariners All,"
Ye mariners all, as ye pass by
Come in and drink if you are dry
Come spend, me lads, your money brisk
And pop your nose in a jug of this

2. O mariners all, if you've half a crown
You're welcome all for to sit down
Come spend, me lads, your money brisk
And pop your nose in a jug of this

3. O tipplers all, as you pass by
Come in and drink if you are dry
Come in and drink, think not amiss
And pop your nose in a jug of this

4. O now I'm old and can scarcely crawl
I've a long grey beard and a head that's bald
Crown my desire, fulfill my bliss
A pretty girl and a jug of this

5. And when I'm in my grave and dead
And all my sorrows are past and fled
Transform me then into a fish
And let me swim in a jug of this
"
219,Ye Parliament of England,"
Ye Parliament of England,
You Lords and commons, too,
Consider well what you're about
And what you're going to do.
You're now to fight with Yankees,
I'm sure you'll rue the day,
You roused the Sons of Liberty
In North America.

2. You first confined our commerce,
And said our ships shant trade,
You next impressed our seamen,
And used them as your slaves;
You then insulted Rogers,
While ploughing o'er the main,
And had we not declared war,
You'd have done it o'er again.

3. You thought our frigates were but few,
And Yankees would not fight,
Until brave Hull your Guerriere took,
And banished her from your sight.
The Wasp then took your Frolic,
We'll nothing say to that,
The Poictiers being of the line,
Of course she took her back.

4. Then next, upon Lake Erie,
Where Perry had some fun,
You own he beat your naval force,
And caused them for to run;
This was to you a sore defeat,
The like ne'er known before,
Your British Squadron beat complete
Some took, some run ashore.

5. There's Rogers, in the President,
Will burn, sink, and destroy;
The Congress, on the Brazil coast,
Your commerce will annoy;
The Essex, in the South Seas,
Will put out all your lights,
The flag she waves at her mast-head:
""Free Trade and Sailors' Rights!""

6. Lament, ye sons of Britain,
Far distant is the day
When you'll regain by British force
What you're lost in America;
Go tell your King and parliament,
By all the world 'tis known,
That British force, by sea and land,
By Yankees is o'erthrown.

7. Use every endeavor,
And strive to make a peace,
For Yankee ships are building fast,
Their Navy to increase;
They will enforce their commerce,
The laws by Heaven were made,
That Yankee ships in time of peace,
To any port may trade.
"
220,Young Monroe at Gerry's Rock,"
Come all you true-born shanty boys,
Wherever you may be,
Come sit you on the deacon seat
And listen to me.
I'll sing the jam on Gerry's Rock
And a hero you should know,
The bravest of all shanty-boys,
The foreman, Young Monroe.

2. It was on a Sunday morning,
As you will quickly hear,
Our logs were piled mountain high,
We could not keep them clear.
Our foreman said: ""Come, cheer up, lads,
With heart relieved of fear,
We'll break the jam on Gerry's Rock
And for Saginaw we'll steer.""

3. Now some of them were willing,
While others they were not,
For to work on jams on Sunday
They did not think we ought;
But six of our Canuck boys
Did volunteer to go
And break the jam on Gerry's Rock,
With the foreman, Young Monroe.

4. They had not rolled off many logs
When they heard his clear voice say:
""I'd have you lads on your guard,
For the jam will soon give way.""
These words were hardly spoken
When the mass did break and go,
And it carried of those six brave lads,
And their foreman, Young Monroe.

5. When the rest of our shanty-boys,
The sad news came to hear,
In search of their dead comrades,
To the river they did steer.
Some of the mangled bodies
A-floating down did go,
While crushed and bleeding near the bank
Was that of Young Monroe.

6. They took him from his watery grave,
Smoothed back his raven hair;
There was one fair girl among them
Whose sad cries rent the air;
There was one fair form among them,
A maid from Saginaw town,
Whose moans and cries rose to the skies,
For her true lover who'd gone down.

7. For Clara was a nice young girl,
The riverman's true friend;
She with her widowed mother dear,
Lived near the river's bend.
The wages of her own true love
The boss to her did pay,
And the shanty-boys for her made up
A generous purse next day.

8. They buried him with sorrow deep,
'Twas on the first of May,
Come all you brave shanty-boys
And for your comrade pray.
Engraved upon a hemlock tree
That by the grave did grow,
Was the name and date of the sad fate
Of the foreman, Young Monroe.

9. Fair Clara did not long survive;
Her heart broke with her grief,
And scarcely two months later
Death came to her relief.
And when this time had passed away
And she was called to go,
Her last request was granted,
To rest beside Young Monroe.

10. Come all you brave shanty-boys:
I would have you call and see
Those two green mounds by the riverside,
Where grows the hemlock tree.
The shanty-boys cleared off the wood,
By the lovers there laid low:
'Twas handsome Clara Vernon
And our foreman, Young Monroe.
"
221,Yo Ho Ho,"
Fifteen men on a dead man's chest
Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum
Drink and the devil had done for the rest
Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum.
The mate was fixed by the bosun's pike
The bosun brained with a marlinspike
And cookey's throat was marked belike
It had been gripped by fingers ten;
And there they lay, all good dead men
Like break o'day in a boozing ken
Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum.

2. Fifteen men of the whole ship's list
Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum!
Dead and be damned and the rest gone whist!
Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum!
The skipper lay with his nob in gore
Where the scullion's axe his cheek had shore
And the scullion he was stabbed times four
And there they lay, and the soggy skies
Dripped down in up-staring eyes
In murk sunset and foul sunrise
Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum.

3. Fifteen men of 'em stiff and stark
Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum!
Ten of the crew had the murder mark!
Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum!
Twas a cutlass swipe or an ounce of lead
Or a yawing hole in a battered head
And the scuppers' glut with a rotting red
And there they lay, aye, damn my eyes
Looking up at paradise
All souls bound just contrawise
Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum.

4. Fifteen men of 'em good and true '
Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum!
Ev'ry man jack could ha' sailed with Old Pew,
Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum!
There was chest on chest of Spanish gold
With a ton of plate in the middle hold
And the cabins riot of stuff untold,
And they lay there that took the plum
With sightless glare and their lips struck dumb
While we shared all by the rule of thumb,
Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum!

5. More was seen through a sternlight screen...
Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum
Chartings undoubt where a woman had been
Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum.
'Twas a flimsy shift on a bunker cot
With a dirk slit sheer through the bosom spot
And the lace stiff dry in a purplish blot
Oh was she wench or some shudderin' maid
That dared the knife and took the blade
By God! she had stuff for a plucky jade
Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum.

6. Fifteen men on a dead man's chest
Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum
Drink and the devil had done for the rest
Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum.
We wrapped 'em all in a mains'l tight
With twice ten turns of a hawser's bight
And we heaved 'em over and out of sight,
With a Yo-Heave-Ho! and a fare-you-well
And a sudden plunge in the sullen swell
Ten fathoms deep on the road to hell,
Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum!
"
222,Yo no digo,"
Yo no digo que mi barca se a
La mejor del puerto
Pero digo que no hay otra
De mejores movimientos
Refrain:
No t' embarques, mi bien
No t' embarques, mi amor
Que te mare aras
: En esa embarcaçion. :

2. En nuestro puerto hay muchas barcas
Grandes y bonitas
Pero me gusta solo una,
Porque esta es la mia,
Refrain:
